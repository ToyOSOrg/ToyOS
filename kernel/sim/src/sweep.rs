//! Seed and fuzz-byte sweeps — the simulator's exit criterion.
//!
//! The criterion is "10⁴ seeds + 10⁷ fuzz steps per scenario class with zero
//! invariant violations". Both budgets are parameters here so that the same
//! code runs the small sweep `cargo test` can afford and the full one the
//! gate asks for; what must never differ between them is the checking.
