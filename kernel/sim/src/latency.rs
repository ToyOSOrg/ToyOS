//! How long a task that was owed the CPU waited for it — the instrument the
//! measured policy suite (`sim/tests/policy.rs`) states its bounds in.
//!
//! The invariant walks answer *whether* a rule held. A policy claim needs the
//! number as well: "interactive wakes are prompt" and "nothing starves" are
//! worth exactly what the distribution behind them is, and a bound asserted
//! without one is a bound nobody can watch move. So every interval a task spends
//! owed a dispatch and not getting one is folded in here, split by how it came
//! to be owed one — see [`ReadyCause`], whose three arms carry three different
//! bounds.
//!
//! **Four exact numbers rather than a histogram, and the fourth is the reason.**
//! A power-of-two histogram — [`kernel::sched::cpu::PassCosts`]' scheme, the one
//! thing here that could have been borrowed — answers a quantile to within a
//! factor of two, and every bound this suite states is within a factor of two of
//! the quantity it bounds: one quantum against one quantum plus 2.2 ms of
//! granularity. So the quantile would decide nothing. What the workloads *do*
//! have is a known one-off — the spawn burst, whose stale fair-band keys delay
//! exactly one wake per run — and the exact statement about that is
//! [`Latency::runner_up_ns`]: the second-largest wait in the run, which is a
//! bound on **every wake but one** and needs no interpolation at all.
//!
//! **What the resolution is, stated rather than assumed.** The measurement is
//! taken at step boundaries, so an interval that opens and closes inside one VM
//! step reads as a *zero* rather than as no sample:
//! [`crate::vm::Vm::awaiting`] stamps the moment a wake claims a parked task,
//! which is at the earliest one step before the pass that could dispatch it.

/// One population of waits. Every field is exact — there is no bucketing here to
/// round anything off.
