//! The process table, and what a process is made of.
//!
//! ## What a crash report may take here, and what it may not
//!
//! Every reader in this file but two takes [`PROCESS_TABLE`] with `lock()`. The
//! two that may not — [`dump_crash_diagnostics`] and [`try_for_each_thread`] —
//! are the ones a machine in trouble reaches, and their rule is a rule about the
//! whole path rather than about this file: **a crash report may not wait for any
//! lock, because the faulting thread may be holding it.**
//! `try_recover_from_panic` exists for exactly that thread, so a wait there is a
//! deadlock on the one path in the kernel that must always produce output; and
//! whatever holds this lock while the machine is stuck is a candidate for what
//! is stuck, which is the census's version of the same argument.
//!
//! `try_lock` is what that leaves, and a `try_lock` is a coin toss: the answer
//! it loses is not printed, and until 2026-08-22 the thing it lost was the
//! faulting function's *name*. So the rule has a second half, and it is the one
//! worth stating:
//!
//! > **A crash report does not ask this table for a symbol.** It reads the
//! > symbol table of the task it is reporting on, off that task's own record,
//! > with no lock in the path — [`resolve_user_symbol`], over
//! > `sched::driver::current_symbols`. A name is the part of a report a reader
//! > cannot reconstruct from anything else in it, so it may not be the part that
//! > depends on what some other CPU happened to be doing.
//!
//! What a report still takes from the table is [`dump_crash_diagnostics`]'s
//! page-fault trace — and it still `try_lock`s, still loses sometimes, and says
//! so in the report when it does. That is allowed because the trace is a
//! supplement: the report above it is complete without it. Anything that stops
//! being true of that — anything a reader could not reconstruct — has to leave
//! this table the way the names did.
