//! VirtIO console — single-port (no MULTIPORT). Replaces the 16550 UART
//! as the kernel log channel after init. Per byte, the UART takes two
//! port-IO vmexits (LSR poll + data write); the FIFO drain bit defeats
//! the 16-byte FIFO so a 100-byte log line eats ~200 vmexits. virtio-console
//! takes one notify per submission — host writes the chardev directly with
//! no per-byte stalls.
//!
//! Single-port mode uses queues 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). MULTIPORT is offered by
//! QEMU but not negotiated; the device falls back to port-0-only with no
//! control queues. RX is poll-driven, matching the UART semantics (see
//! `arch/idt/mod.rs` — the legacy PIC is disabled and no UART IRQ handler is
//! wired, so input is polled).
