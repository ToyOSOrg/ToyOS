//! `usbd`: the context USB work runs in, instead of whichever thread trapped.
//!
//! The kernel has three kernel threads and this is the second: `klogd` drains
//! the console (`log/console.rs`), `usbd` owns the xHCI port machine, and
//! `iod` (`crate::iod`) owns the write-back queue. Three and not one, because
//! a stuck USB enumeration must not stop the log — which is exactly what it
//! does today, where [`super::poll_if_pending`] runs at the top of every
//! scheduler pass on every CPU and `wait_transfer` spins with `XHCI` held.
//!
//! **What it will own, and what it owns now.** C7 moves `poll_if_pending` off
//! `drain_irqs` and onto this thread, C9 hands it the i8042's verdict as a
//! deadline park and the polled-device shape that goes with it, and both need
//! `XHCI` to be a `SleepLock`, because a lock converted alone parks with the
//! other three still ticket locks. Until then the body
//! below is one park: the thread exists, it is scheduled, it is named in
//! `ps` and in Ctrl+Alt+D, and its panic row says what a panic in it costs.
//!
//! **Spawned on every machine, including one with no xHCI at all.** There is
//! one of each kernel thread, machine-wide; a controller-less machine gets a
//! thread with nothing to do, which is the same thing every machine has until
//! C7 and costs one 16 KiB kernel stack. Making the spawn conditional would put
//! a second answer to "how many kernel threads does this machine have" in the
//! tree, and `sched::kthread`'s `MAX_KERNEL_TASKS` is the first.
//!
//! **Its panic is recoverable, and `klogd`'s is deliberately not.** A killed
//! `usbd` costs the machine its USB port machine — hot-plug stops working and
//! the boot disk keeps whatever it already had — and every one of those losses
//! is *visible*: the device does not appear, the dump names the thread as gone.
//! A killed `klogd` costs the machine its only console drainer, which is the
//! one failure nothing left alive can report, so that thread halts instead
//! (`log/console.rs`).
