//! Taking the xHC away from firmware before resetting it (xHCI spec §4.22.1).
//!
//! A PC's firmware often keeps the USB controller for its own use — legacy
//! keyboard emulation, so a pre-boot menu works without a USB stack — and the
//! mechanism it uses is SMM: an SMI fires on the events named in USBLEGCTLSTS
//! and the handler drives the controller behind the OS's back. Resetting a
//! controller SMM still owns does not fail loudly. It fails the way the laptop
//! fails: the firmware and the kernel take turns programming the same
//! registers, and the machine reaches userland with something dead and no line
//! anywhere saying why.
//!
//! **The capability list is firmware's, so it is untrusted input.** CLAUDE.md's
//! corollary applies literally: nothing here panics, nothing here loops on a
//! number firmware chose, and a list that makes no sense costs the handoff and
//! never the boot. The walk terminates for three independent reasons — the next
//! pointer is a strictly positive *forward* delta (spec §7.1.1: dwords from the
//! start of *this* capability, zero meaning end of list), every read is bounds
//! checked against the mapped window, and the iteration count is capped — and it
//! would still terminate with any *one* of them removed. Not any two: with the
//! window check and the cap both gone the forward delta alone climbs through
//! the u64 space, which is what the self-test's last case ("an endless chain
//! inside a window that never ends") is a demonstration of.
//!
//! QEMU cannot exercise any of this. Its xHC publishes no Legacy Support
//! capability and nothing owns the controller once OVMF's USB stack lets go at
//! ExitBootServices, so on the only machine in reach the handoff is a walk that
//! finds nothing. That is why the malformed lists have a self-test
//! (`xhci-xecp-selftest`) rather than a boot to point at.
