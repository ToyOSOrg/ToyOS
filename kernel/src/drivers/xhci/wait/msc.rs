//! USB Mass Storage, Bulk-Only Transport with a transparent SCSI command set
//! (interface class 0x08, subclass 0x06, protocol 0x50).
//!
//! Everything that arrives here came off a wire, so nothing in this file may
//! panic on it: a capacity, a block size, a CSW tag and a residue are all
//! numbers a broken or hostile device chooses. They are checked and the device
//! is refused by name — never truncated to fit, and never trusted because the
//! transfer that carried them succeeded.

//! **This file is the tree's one user of [`crate::mm::Unaligned`]**, and the
//! reason is the Command Block Wrapper: USB BOT 1.0 §5.1 and §5.2 lay a CBW and
//! a CSW out as bytes at fixed offsets, and neither is a structure a Rust ABI
//! would produce. Nothing races those two reads and writes either — a CBW is
//! written before the transfer naming it is enqueued and a CSW is read after
//! `framed_phase` returned `Ok` — so the volatile discipline would be claiming
//! an ordering the transport already provides. Everything else here moves whole
//! buffers with `copy_from`/`copy_to`, which both disciplines share.
//!
//! `read_dma` and `write_dma`, the sweep's local four-caller wrappers for those
//! two copies, are `Dma::copy_to` and `Dma::copy_from` now.
