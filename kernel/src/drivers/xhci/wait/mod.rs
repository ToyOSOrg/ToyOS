//! Everything in this driver that waits, and the three contexts where waiting
//! is correct.
//!
//! **This module is the split X2b builds, and it is a module rather than a
//! type.** `poll_if_pending` runs at the top of every scheduler pass on every
//! CPU, so nothing it reaches may spin on a device: a `USB_TIMEOUT_NS` spent
//! there is spent by every CPU that enters a pass, and pulling the boot stick
//! out of a laptop aims a filesystem sync, a page-cache fill and the scheduler at
//! the same dead device.
//!
//! A view handed to the poll would not have enforced it. Rust makes a module's
//! private items visible to its *descendants*, so `xhci::device` and
//! `xhci::hid` can name anything `xhci` keeps private — including a view's own
//! field. The primitives therefore live **below** the poll rather than beside
//! it: `wait_command`, `wait_transfer`, `settles`, `run_command`,
//! `control_transfer`, `restart_endpoint` and `settle_outstanding` are private
//! to this module, and `xhci`, `xhci::device` and `xhci::hid` are not inside
//! it. A pass that tried to wait does not compile.
//!
//! The three descendants are the three contexts:
//!
//! - [`boot`] — the scan. There is no scheduler yet, so the pass this would
//!   give itself back to does not exist.
//! - [`msc`] — a disk. `storage_read` and `storage_write` run on the thread
//!   that faulted, which is spending its own time.
//! - [`msc::bind`] — **the one door**, and the only blocking thing a scheduler
//!   pass can still reach. A disk plugged in after boot has to be brought up by
//!   somebody, its bring-up is Bulk-Only Transport, and that is a machine of
//!   its own that has not been written yet
//!   (`issues/hardware/the-bot-scsi-machine-is-still-hand-written-in-the-kernel.md`).
//!   Until then the claim above holds of everything except a disk arriving
//!   after boot.
//!
//! # Two bounds, and only one of them is this driver's
//!
//! [`USB_TIMEOUT_NS`] bounds *one* command or transfer, and it is reached only
//! by a device that has stopped answering. What a caller actually spends is the
//! composition above it — `ceil(count / MSC_MAX_BLOCKS)` commands, each of them
//! issued up to [`msc`]'s `MAX_TRANSPORT_ATTEMPTS` times with a Reset Recovery
//! between the attempts — and nothing in this driver has an opinion about how
//! long that may be. [`crate::block::OPERATION`] is that opinion, and it
//! belongs to the layer that knows one call is one operation.
//!
//! **It arrives ambiently and is threaded from there.** Owner ruling 1B: the
//! deadline is established on the running context above `BlockDevice` and
//! recovered by [`msc`]'s three operation entry points — `msc_read`,
//! `msc_write`, `msc_flush` — because the two frames in between cannot carry
//! it. From those three down it is an ordinary argument, ending at
//! `XhciController::scsi`, which is the one site that reads it; that is what
//! leaves `scsi` usable by `msc::bind`'s bring-up, which is not a block-device
//! operation, has no establishment above it, and passes [`Deadline::never`] by
//! name. `block::OPERATION`'s doc carries why the refusal is taken between
//! commands and never inside one.
//!
//! [`Deadline::never`]: crate::time::Deadline::never
