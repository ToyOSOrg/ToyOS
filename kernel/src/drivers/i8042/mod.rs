//! The i8042 PS/2 controller: the laptop's built-in keyboard, and its
//! TrackPoint on the aux port.
//!
//! **Init treats the machine as untrusted.** Firmware and an embedded
//! controller are not kernel code; CLAUDE.md's corollary applies literally.
//! Every wait is bounded against the wall clock, nothing panics, and a
//! controller that does not answer costs the keyboard and never the boot.
//! Each failure is one short line, because on a machine with no UART those
//! lines are read off the next boot checkpoint's repaint of the log tail.
//!
//! **The ISR reads the device, which no other ISR here does.** Every other
//! device has a DMA ring its consumer can re-derive from, so those handlers
//! only timestamp. The i8042 has a one-byte output buffer and will not
//! assert another edge until it is read, so draining in the ISR is the only
//! correct shape rather than a shortcut. That makes the prohibitions below
//! load-bearing rather than stylistic:
//!
//! - **No `Lock`.** `Lock::lock` disables preemption but not interrupts
//!   (`sync.rs`), so an ISR taking a lock a thread on the same CPU holds
//!   self-deadlocks. The handler touches neither `PS2`, nor the key/mouse
//!   queues, nor the I/O APIC. The prohibition binds every *other* ISR too:
//!   `drain` holds those locks in thread context, so any handler that reached
//!   them — the timer tick's device poll was the one that could — wedges the
//!   CPU rather than this one misbehaving.
//! - **No allocation.** `VecDeque::push_back` reaches the allocator, and a
//!   panic holding the allocator lock wedges the recovered CPU.
//! - **No `log!`.** It is ISR-safe, and it is still banned: at key-repeat
//!   rates it is noise, and the ring lock is a same-CPU spin for nothing.
//! - **No wake.** Waking enters the scheduler and possibly sends an IPI.
//! - **No unbounded loop.** A controller with OBF stuck high would spin a
//!   CPU with IF=0 forever; hence `ISR_BURST` and the quarantine.
//!
//! This module imports neither `alloc` nor `sync::Lock` into the ISR's
//! reach: the byte ring is a static of atomics, and everything that needs a
//! lock lives behind `service`, which runs in thread context only.
//!
//! **Delivery is pinned to one CPU** (`IRQ_CPU`, physical destination), which
//! is what makes the ISR the sole reader of port 0x60 and the byte ring a
//! genuine single-producer queue. Two CPUs taking these interrupts would
//! race on a one-byte register. Input is ~100 Hz; there is no load argument
//! for spreading it.
//!
//! The corollary binds the *drain*, which runs on whichever CPU entered the
//! scheduler: any polled port I/O it wants to do — the aux re-enable is the
//! only one — has to happen on `IRQ_CPU` with interrupts off there. Nothing
//! weaker works. Masking the redirection entries does not: it stops neither an
//! ISR already executing nor a vector already latched in that CPU's LAPIC, and
//! an edge asserted on a masked edge-triggered entry is dropped outright.

//
// - **Only when the pin has asserted since the last line.** A machine nobody is

/// with three causes, and it cannot separate them:
///
/// - **the controller is still holding a byte nobody took.** Delivery is edge
///   triggered, so it does not assert again until port 0x60 is read, and the
///   only reader is an ISR that will never run. `OBF` set on sample after
///   sample is that state and nothing else is.
/// - **the redirection entry changed.** Masked, re-pointed, or carrying a
///   vector that is no longer ours — all one word, printed raw.
/// - **neither, and the counters are flat**, which puts the fault at the EC or
///   the device and takes this driver out of it.
///
/// Every read is free of side effects: 0x64 is the status register, and an
/// entry is read through `IOREGSEL`/`IOWIN` under the topology's own lock. So
/// this does not have to run on the CPU the vector is pinned to, and it does
/// not disturb the ISR's sole ownership of 0x60.
///
/// Behind `heartbeat` because it can only be asked from the idle loop and only
/// a `diag-tick` build reaches that on a machine with nothing to run — which is
/// exactly the machine it is for.
