//! The 16550 and the virtio-console, and the one lock that serialises them.
//!
//! **There is one thing here now where there were two.** `SerialWriter` was a
//! per-invocation stack buffer that every `log!` formatted into and committed
//! to a 64 KiB byte ring, which something else drained later; the ring is gone
//! and what reaches this file is whole units — a rendered record from
//! `log::console`, a userland `write`, a panic report — each of which takes
//! [`BackendGuard`] once and holds it for its own whole unit. That is where
//! line atomicity comes from, and it is the only place it could come from: two
//! producers of half-lines cannot be made atomic by anything downstream of
//! them.
//!
//! [`BackendGuard`] is CLI plus a global spinlock, so an interrupts-off window
//! is one unit long. The slow I/O happens inside it, which is why **every unit
//! is bounded and no holder may take its length from userland** — a rendered
//! record is one 1 KiB `LogRecord`, the live drain takes eight of them, the
//! panic report is a fixed buffer, and a `write` of arbitrary length is cut
//! into [`MAX_CONSOLE_LINE`] pieces by [`ConsoleLine`]. The one deliberate
//! exception is the panic path's `drain_locked`, which takes the whole backlog
//! under one hold — a machine that is dying pays latency to say why, and
//! `log/console.rs` argues it at the site. Nothing that holds a kernel lock
