//! NVMe, as a [`BlockDevice`].
//!
//! **One command outstanding at a time**, which is a property of this driver
//! and not of the protocol: every submission goes through `submit_and_wait`, so
//! the completion at the head of a queue is always the one the caller asked
//! for. `wait_completion`'s `cid` comparison is what checks that rather than
//! assuming it.
//!
//! # Two bounds, and only one of them is this driver's
//!
//! [`COMMAND`] bounds *one* command, and it is reached only by a controller
//! that has stopped answering. What a caller actually spends is the composition
//! above it — one `read_blocks` of N blocks is `ceil(N / 32)` commands — and
//! nothing in this driver has an opinion about how long that may be.
//! [`crate::block::OPERATION`] is that opinion, and it belongs to the layer
//! that knows one call is one operation.
//!
//! **It arrives ambiently and is threaded from there.** Owner ruling 1B: the
//! deadline is established on the running context by
//! [`crate::block::begin_operation`] in [`NvmeBlockDevice`]'s trait methods —
//! this file is both the establisher and the driver, where the USB path needs
//! two files for it — recovered by `read_blocks` and `write_blocks`, and from
//! there an ordinary argument down to `read_sectors` and `write_sectors`, which
//! are the two sites that read it. `admin` is deliberately outside that: it is
//! reached only from [`init`], bringing a controller up is not a block-device
//! operation and has no establishment above it, so it takes no deadline
//! argument and asking for one would panic the boot by name. What bounds it is
//! [`COMMAND`], like every other command here.
//!
//! **The refusal is taken between commands and never inside one**, for the
//! reason `XhciController::scsi` states at length: ending a wait at the
//! caller's deadline abandons a command the device is still going to answer.
//! Here that costs more than it does there — what takes an abandoned command
//! back is a whole controller reset ([`NvmeController::reset`]), spent once
//! per silence and with one post-reset command as its whole allowance — see
//! [`COMMAND`].
