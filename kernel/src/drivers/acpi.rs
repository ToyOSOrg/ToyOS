//! ACPI table parsing.
//!
//! Every byte here is **firmware-supplied, i.e. untrusted input**, and the
//! distinction CLAUDE.md draws applies in full: fail-fast is for kernel bugs,
//! not for a length a machine we have never booted put in a header. So this
//! module has no panic on any input path. A table that cannot be believed is a
//! [`TableError`] with a reason, and the caller decides — because the callers
//! want opposite things from the same refusal. The i8042 driver must tell
//! "firmware says there is no 8042" from "firmware's answer is not readable",
//! because it prints them differently and they are different facts; it probes
//! on both, since its own handshake is better evidence than either.
//!
//! Nothing reads a table except through [`Table::open`], which is what makes
//! the bounds hold by construction rather than by review. The two subtractions
//! that replaced — `length - size_of::<SdtHeader>()` in the XSDT walk and
//! `length - size_of::<Madt>()` in the MADT walk — were both "the header
//! declared itself shorter than its own header", and with overflow checks off
//! the first one produces an entry count near 2^61 and walks arbitrary
//! physical memory as if it were a table pointer array.
