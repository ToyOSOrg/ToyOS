//! USB mass storage as a [`BlockDevice`].
//!
//! The disks themselves live inside the xHCI controller, because that is where
//! their transfer rings and DMA blocks are and because every command has to
//! serialise against the event ring the HID path also drains. What lives here
//! is the handle: one per bound disk, holding nothing but an index and the
//! geometry the device reported, so the controller lock is taken per operation
//! and never held across one.
//!
//! **This is where an operation's device-time budget is established**
//! ([`crate::block::begin_operation`]), because this is the layer at which one
//! call is one operation: below here the driver batches, retries and recovers,
//! and none of those loops knows what it is part of. What bounds a
//! `read_blocks` of 64 blocks is therefore the same instant that bounds its
//! first command.
//!
//! **Established on the running context and not passed down**, which is owner
//! ruling 1B: the deadline crosses `BlockAccess` and `BlockDevice`, two frames
//! that cannot carry it, so `xhci::wait/msc.rs`'s three operation entry points
//! recover it instead. The guard is a `let _op` and not a `let _`: `let _`
//! drops at the end of the statement, which would end the operation before the
//! call it bounds.
