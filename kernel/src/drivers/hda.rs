//! The Intel HDA stub: bring-up, one output stream, and the allow-list.
//!
//! **The line is who touches a register.** The kernel resets
//! the controller, allocates the PCM ring and the buffer descriptor list,
//! programs every register whose value is an address or indexes one of those
//! structures, acknowledges the interrupt and derives the completion mask from
//! `SDnLPIB`. The driver — soundd — decides everything: which codecs answered,
//! which pin, which converter, the amplifiers, EAPD, the format. It reaches the
//! five registers those decisions land in through [`reg_write`], and the two it
//! has to poll through [`reg_read`], each checked against a positive list and
//! refused by name.
//!
//! Nothing here decides. The moment this file has to know which codec or which
//! pin, the line has moved and this stub has become a driver.
//!
//! Register offsets, bit positions and the descriptor layout come from the
//! Intel High Definition Audio specification.
