//! Safe user memory access via page table walk + kernel direct map.

//! User virtual addresses are translated to physical via page table walk,
//! then accessed through the kernel's high-half direct map (PHYS_OFFSET).
//! SMAP stays enabled 100% — no stac/clac anywhere.
//!
//! **Nothing here hands out a reference to user memory.** Small values are
//! copied ([`SyscallContext::copy_in`], [`SyscallContext::copy_out`]), strings
//! are copied, and bulk buffers are a [`UserBytes`] / [`UserBytesMut`] window
//! the kernel reads or writes but never borrows — see [`UserBytes`] for why the
//! borrow is the bug.
//!
//! **Every read of a single user word in this kernel is a `read_volatile`, and
//! the two that are not in this module obey it too**: the futex word the
//! scheduler evaluates on each wake check, and the crash dump's walk of a dying
//! process's memory. A plain load is one the compiler may hoist out of a loop,
//! fold with a neighbour or split in two, and another thread of the same
//! process can change the bytes between any two instructions — so "the kernel
//! read this once" is a claim only the volatile spelling makes. The bulk
//! windows are the deliberate exception and [`UserBytes`] says why: there the
//! absence of the reference is what buys it, and per-byte volatile would cost
//! the copy several times its throughput for nothing.
