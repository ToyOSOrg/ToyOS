//! Building a process out of an ELF file.
//!
//! `spawn` reads only headers and tables — segment contents arrive one page
//! fault at a time — so what it produces is an address space of demand-paged
//! regions plus a relocation index the fault handler applies as each page
//! arrives. Shared libraries are the exception: they are loaded eagerly into
//! kernel pages, because they are shared between processes.
//!
//! Every number the file names is untrusted. A refusal is
//! `SyscallError::{InvalidArgument, ResourceExhausted}` with a log line naming
//! the path and the field, never a panic and never a silent truncation.

// Every unsafe block under `loader::` carries a `SAFETY:` comment —
// measured and documented in full by
// `issues/build/clippy-has-never-run-here.md`'s per-area plan.
// `host-tests.yml`'s kernel clippy step already runs with `-D warnings`, so
// `warn` here is what actually gates: a new undocumented block anywhere in
// this module tree fails CI, while the rest of the kernel (not yet swept)
// stays silent.
