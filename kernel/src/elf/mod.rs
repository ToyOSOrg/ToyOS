//! Loading a shared object: the effects half of ELF.
//!
//! Decoding lives in `toyos-elf`, which is pure and host-tested. What is here
//! is everything that touches memory — the image allocation, the segment read,
//! the private writable window, the symbol views over kernel pages — plus the
//! kernel's own ceilings, which are policy and not a property of the format.
//!
//! The rule that governs the whole module: an ELF is untrusted input, so
//! nothing here panics on a malformed one. Refusals are `&'static str` because
//! every caller logs them beside the path.

// Every unsafe block under `elf::` carries a `SAFETY:` comment
// (`issues/build/clippy-has-never-run-here.md` holds the tree-wide plan).
// `host-tests.yml`'s kernel clippy step runs with `-D warnings`, so this `warn`
// is what gates: a new undocumented block in this module tree fails CI.
