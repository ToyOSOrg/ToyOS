//! The kernel side of an [inbox](toyos_abi::inbox) — shared-memory submission
//! and completion rings.
//!
//! Two syscalls: `inbox_setup` (create one) and `inbox_submit` (submit + wait).
//! The submission ring, the completion ring and the submission array live in a
//! single 2MB shared page accessible to both kernel (via direct map) and
//! userspace (via page table mapping).
//!
//! One-shot `OP_WATCH`: each fires once, then the pending poll is consumed.
//! Userspace must re-submit to re-arm.
//!
//! **A third thing in this kernel is also called an inbox, and it is not
//! this one.** `completion::Inbox` is a *task's* bounded record ring, minted
//! at spawn and never named by a handle — a different type for a different
//! purpose, one level below this one. What a process holds a handle to is
//! `object::inbox::InboxObject`, the counted reference to the mechanism this
//! file owns; that struct's own header names this one back.
//!
//! Lock ordering: the wake path copies watcher lists under source locks (PIPES,
//! LISTENERS, device locks), releases them, then acquires INBOXES.
//! The recheck path in process_watch holds INBOXES while calling source
//! readiness checks (which acquire source locks internally). This is safe
//! because no path holds source locks while acquiring INBOXES.

    // A `&RingHeader` is the sharper of the two: three of its four fields are

    // moment, so the reference itself is a data race whatever the kernel then
