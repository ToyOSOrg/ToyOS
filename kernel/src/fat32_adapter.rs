//! The two partitions this kernel was given, as mounted filesystems.
//!
//! UEFI mandates FAT32 on the partition firmware loads a bootloader from, so
//! this is the one filesystem a ToyOS machine is guaranteed to have before it
//! has any other. The log partition beside it is FAT32 for a different reason —
//! it is the format every desktop OS mounts off a stick without being asked.
//! `toyos-fat32` reads and writes both; this file is the two things that crate
//! deliberately does not know about — the kernel's 4 KiB [`BlockDevice`], and
//! [`vfs::FileSystem`].
//!
//! # Why neither can become "some disk we found"
//!
//! Three independent gates, and a volume is untouched unless all three pass:
//!
//! 1. **Which partition.** [`gpt::boot_volume`] and [`gpt::log_volume`] answer,
//!    and they answer only for unique partition GUIDs the kernel was handed
//!    through `KernelArgs` — the boot partition's from firmware, cross-checked
//!    against the table's own extent and accepted only when exactly one device
//!    carries it, and the log partition's from a file on that volume, looked
//!    for only on the device the boot partition was found on. Nothing here
//!    scans for a FAT signature and nothing here looks at a partition *type*.
//!    In particular the log partition is not "the other FAT32 on the stick",
//!    which would have needed no handoff at all and is the defect the handoff
//!    exists to make unrepresentable.
//! 2. **Which bytes.** [`FatDevice`] clamps every read and every write to the
//!    volume before it reaches the device, so a filesystem that computed a wild
//!    offset gets [`IoError`] rather than a neighbour's blocks. This is the
//!    adapter's invariant and not the filesystem's to be trusted about:
//!    `BlockAccess`'s own documentation claims the crate "never asks for bytes
//!    it has not already bounded against the volume", and the storage-stack
//!    audit reproduced a crafted directory entry driving a write 256 GiB past
//!    the end of one. A driver escaping its partition is how a boot stick's
//!    other partitions get destroyed — and with two mounted at once, the
//!    neighbour it would escape into is the other one.
//!
//!    The bound is the *volume*, tighter than the partition: [`Fat32::probe`]
//!    reads the boot sector without mounting, and the sector count in it is
//!    what the filesystem may legitimately address. Slack between the volume
//!    and the end of the partition is then unreachable too. A partition's first
//!    byte need not be 4 KiB-aligned in general, so a write to it is a
//!    read-modify-write of a device block it shares with whatever is next to
//!    it — which preserves those bytes rather than authoring them.
//! 3. **Whether it is already ours.** `toyos-fat32` contains no code that can
//!    write a BPB. A volume that does not parse as FAT32 makes [`mount`] return
//!    `None` after nothing but reads, and there is no path from there to a
//!    format, because no such path exists to take.
//!
//! # What these mounts are not
//!
//! Not a general FAT32 mount service. Two volumes, both named by the handoff,
//! mounted once at boot. A third FAT32 partition on the same disk is not
//! reachable from here and should not become reachable without the same three
//! gates.

/// neither `/boot` nor `/log` on one boot and mounted both on the next, off the
/// same stick and the same image, which is a race and not a defect in anything
/// downstream of here.

/// The asymmetry is the same one `xhci::EMPTY_BUS` is written around, and it
