//! Where the kernel's wait *subjects* live.
//!
//! **There is no wait queue in this file any more.** Every waitable
//! object owns a [`Watch`] and a waiter arms on it; the park itself is on the
//! waiter's own thread queue (`TaskHandle::park_queue`), which is the one list
//! left in the kernel and has exactly one member. Objects with a lifetime own
//! an `Arc<Watch>` (pipe ends, listeners, inbox rings), singleton devices own
//! a `static`, and futex words — which have no object at all — hash into a fixed
//! bucket array, because a bucket is a *place to arm*, not a set whose
//! membership means anything.
//!
//! **A shared bucket is not a shared wake.** A watcher carries the token it
//! armed with, and a futex waiter's token is its word's physical address, so
//! `completion::post_n` walks the bucket and names the word. Sharing a bucket
//! therefore costs a list walk and not a spurious wake — which is what makes
//! `SYS_FUTEX_WAKE`'s count and its return value mean anything.
