//! The kernel driver for the scheduler core.
//!
//! This file is plumbing and nothing else: percpu, the asm switch, the idle
//! loop, the trampoline. It decides nothing. Every scheduling decision, state
//! transition and ordering-sensitive step happens above it, in `toyos-sched`,
//! where the simulator drives the same code.
//!
//! The shape of a scheduler entry is fixed and total:
//!
//! ```text
//! preempt::disable()
//! drain device IRQ records into wakes
//! with_cpu(|cpu| SchedPass::begin(cpu, env, now).dispose_*().finish())
//! match action { Run(tok) => switch(tok), Resume => {}, Idle(tok) => halt }
//! preempt::enable_no_resched()
//! ```
//!
//! Everything after the switch belongs to whichever task resumes on this
//! stack, and there is nothing scheduler-related left to do there — no guard to
//! release, no outgoing task to park. That is what park-before-switch buys, and
//! it is sound only because a wake for the just-parked task is a *message to
//! this same CPU*, which cannot be consumed before the switch completes.
//!
//! **What is *not* done by the time the pass ends is the save.** `switch`'s
//! last instruction writes the outgoing context's `rsp`, and everything above
//! it — the `with_cpu` return, `charge_cpu_time`, the publish, CR3, `TSS.rsp0`,
//! the FS base — runs with that context still holding the stack pointer from
//! the *previous* time it was switched away, or, for a task that never has
//! been, `alloc_kernel_stack`'s entry frame. Any CPU that restores it inside
//! that window lands on a stack this one is standing on.

///
/// * **The idle mask** is the per-CPU `Doorbell` SLEEPING bit in [`cpus`],
///   published by the idle disposition before its final mailbox check.
/// * **The wake** is the ordinary kick IPI ([`crate::hw::KernelHw::kick`] →
///   `apic::kick_cpu`), sent to **one** sleeping CPU per surplus-publishing
///   pass, cursor-walked so consecutive pushes reach different sleepers, and
///   edge-coalesced by the doorbell so a CPU with an IPI already coming is not
///   kicked twice. The woken CPU posts an ordinary steal probe — the push adds
///   no second way to move a task.
/// * **The lost-wakeup race** is closed two-sided: the idler publishes
///   SLEEPING, then re-reads the surplus behind `cpu::balance_fence` (a
///   `SeqCst` fence, `mfence`) and stays awake if it sees any; the producer
///   publishes its surplus, then reads SLEEPING behind the same fence. The
///   final look runs under `cli` in [`execute`] and [`crate::hw::KernelHw::halt`]
///   is one `sti; hlt` atom, so a kick between the check and the halt is taken,
///   not slept through. `toyos-sched/loom/tests/loom_push.rs` is the model, and
///   its `push-fence-relaxed` feature is the control that reds without the
///   fence.
/// * **The backstop** for imbalance with no enqueue behind it is the busy
///   CPU's own timer tick: a CPU running a task always has its quantum armed,
///   every tick reaches a pass, and every pass exit re-runs the push — so all
///   periodic cost lives on already-awake CPUs and an idle CPU sleeps
///   unbounded.
///
/// A machine with no surplus never pushes, which is what keeps the policy off
