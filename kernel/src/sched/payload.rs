//! What the kernel attaches to a task, and the two environment-supplied
//! pieces the core crate refuses to implement itself: the leaf lock and the
//! saved-context type.
//!
//! The split between [`KernelCtx`] and [`KernelPayload`] is not cosmetic. The
//! context switch reaches a task through a raw `*mut X::Ctx` and nothing else,
//! so everything the switch needs — rsp, cr3, fs_base, the kernel stack top,
//! the identity to publish into percpu — lives in the context. Everything the
//! *kernel* needs about a live task and must release exactly once lives in the
//! payload, which only `Hw::release` ever consumes.
