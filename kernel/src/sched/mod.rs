//! The kernel's half of the scheduler core; `toyos-sched` decides.
//!
//! * [`payload`] — what the kernel attaches to a task, and the two pieces the
//!   core crate refuses to implement itself.
//! * [`driver`] — percpu `CpuSched` slot, pass entry, asm switch, idle loop,
//!   trampoline. Decides nothing.
//! * [`waitqs`] — where the kernel's wait queues live.
//! * [`dump`] — Ctrl+Alt+D, the machine-wide blocked-task report.
//! * [`kthread`] — a task with no address space, and what its panic means.
//! * [`reap_gate`] — the flag that keeps the idle loop off the process table
//!   when there is nothing to reap.
//!
//! The kernel-facing API — everything the rest of the kernel calls — is
//! `crate::scheduler`.

// Every `unsafe` block under `sched::` has either stopped existing or carries a
// `SAFETY:` saying why it could not — the reduction-before-documentation sweep
// `issues/build/clippy-has-never-run-here.md` records. `host-tests.yml`'s two
// kernel clippy invocations both run with `-D warnings`, so `warn` here is what
// gates: a new undocumented block anywhere in this module tree fails CI.
