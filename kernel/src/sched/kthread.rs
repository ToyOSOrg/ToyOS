//! Kernel threads: a task with no address space of its own, and the one place
//! that says what a panic inside one means.
//!
//! There are three: `klogd`, the console drainer; `drivers::xhci::usbd`; and
//! `crate::iod`. [`ROWS`] carries all three, and the machine has one thread per
//! kind of work that must not borrow whichever thread happened to trap — a
//! stuck USB enumeration must not stop the log.
//!
//! **A kernel thread is not a special kind of task.** It is an ordinary task
//! that names `mm::paging::kernel` as its address space — the one every CPU is
//! already in between two user threads — reached through a trampoline that
//! never issues an `iretq` (`loader::start::kernel_start`). It shows up in `ps`
//! and in Ctrl+Alt+D, and it logs like anything else.
//!
//! **It is preemptible and stealable only where its body reaches a preemption
//! point, and a Ring 0 loop does not.** `need_resched` is set by the timer's
//! Ring 0 stub on every tick and read in exactly two places: the Ring 3 exit
//! check, and `preempt::enable`'s slow path when the count reaches zero. A body
//! that never returns to Ring 3 and takes no `Lock` reaches neither, so the
//! byte is set on every tick and nothing ever consumes it. Migration follows
//! from that and not from a second mechanism — only a *Ready* task is stolen,
//! so a task that is never switched out never moves, and a park that does reach
//! the scheduler comes back to the CPU it left. `log::storm`'s header carries
//! the measurement: three workload shapes at `--smp 8`, and 0 of 8 and 0 of 16
//! producers ever wrote to a second CPU's shard. Anything that needs a kernel
//! thread to run on two CPUs has to be given a preemption point, and a body
//! like these three is not one.
//!
//! It gets a process-table entry rather than a bare task, and that is what
//! makes it nameable: `share_for` is keyed by `Pid`, `sched::dump`'s census
//! walks the table, and `crash_report_panic` prints the process's *name* — so
//! without an entry a panicking kernel thread would report a pid nothing in the
//! machine could resolve.
