//! Where every interrupt lands, counted on the CPU that took it.
//!
//! **Why it exists.** Every message-signalled interrupt in
//! this kernel is addressed to physical destination 0 (`drivers::pci`'s
//! `MSG_ADDR`) and the one I/O APIC pin this kernel routes goes to the BSP's
//! APIC id, so every device interrupt lands on the boot CPU and is spread from
//! there by `irq_ring` plus the scheduler. That is a design with a ceiling —
//! one CPU's interrupt bandwidth is the machine's — and the ceiling is only
//! worth moving against a number. This is that number: a per-CPU, per-source
//! delivery count, printed as one `irq: cpuN …` line per CPU beside the
//! process-exit census (`process::exit`), on `SYS_SHUTDOWN` and on the
//! blocked-task dump.
//!
//! **The counters are in `PerCpu`, so recording one is a single instruction.**
//! `irq_took!` emits exactly `add qword ptr gs:[<off>], 1` twice — once for the
//! machine's total and once for the source — with no register, no lock prefix
//! and no memory operand outside this CPU's own block. Two reasons that is
//! sound without a `lock`:
//!
//!   * **Same-CPU only.** Every writer is an interrupt handler indexing through
//!     `gs:`, which cannot name another CPU's block, and every reader is an
//!     `AtomicU64` load. There is no cross-CPU read-modify-write to lose.
//!   * **One instruction retires whole.** Interrupts — the NMI included — are
//!     taken at instruction boundaries, so an interrupt landing "inside" a
//!     non-locked `add [mem], 1` is not a state the machine has. This is the
//!     same argument `PerCpu::ring0_timer_fires`' plain `inc` rests on, and the
//!     opposite of `preempt_count`'s, which is a Rust load-add-store that an
//!     interrupt really can split.
//!
//! **The total is counted apart from the sources, and that is the whole of what
//! makes the census checkable.** `total` is not derived from the per-source
//! words: it is its own increment, written beside them, so a source whose
//! increment is missing shows up as `total > Σ sources` rather than as a number
//! that is quietly too small. `irq_census_conservation` is the gate that asks.
//!
//! **Reading it.** An interrupt count is a function of timing and moves between
//! runs — the distribution is what to compare, and a test that boots and runs
//! no program reaches no process exit and prints no census. **Every device
//! interrupt (xhci, net, sound, i8042) is the boot CPU's**; what is already
//! spread is the timer and the shootdown IPI, which are per-CPU by
//! construction. `issues/kernel/every-interrupt-lands-on-the-boot-cpu.md`
//! carries the tables.
//!
//! **What is not counted, and why.** CPU exceptions are not interrupts a
//! placement policy will ever place — they are raised by the instruction stream
//! on the CPU that ran it — so `common_entry` counts nothing and the identity
//! above is unaffected. Vector 0xFD (the halt IPI) never returns: it is `cli;
//! hlt` forever, and a census the machine can no longer print is not one.
//! `LOG_NEST_VECTOR` is the `boot-actuators` self-IPI the log's own gate sends
//! itself; counting it would make the census's shape depend on a build feature,
//! which two builds cannot be compared across.
