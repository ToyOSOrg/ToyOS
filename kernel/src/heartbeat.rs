//! One line every quarter second saying the machine is still running, and
//! which CPUs are still alive.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! A laptop that freezes at boot leaves a log **byte-identical** to a healthy
//! one's. Ten logs off the owner's stick: seven of 214 lines and three of 216,
//! the three long ones differing only by two `compositor: frames=` reports, and
//! every log's last kernel line at ~1.33 s whether that boot lived or died.
//! Nothing that fails leaves a trace on its way down, and nothing that survives
//! leaves one either — a live idle desktop and a dead machine produce the same
//! file, because the last thing either has to say is the same.
//!
//! So the log cannot answer *was this boot alive at time T*, and every
//! conclusion about the freeze has had to come from a photograph of a panel or
//! from `metal-panic-probe` firing once at claim + 5 s. This makes the answer
//! continuous: a frozen boot's log ends at the last heartbeat before it died,
//! which is the **time** of death rather than only the fact of it.
//!
//! # What the first build got wrong, and what `alive=` means now
//!
//! The first build ran from the idle loop and nothing else, and its own doc
//! conceded that a clear bit meant only "this CPU did not reach a pass". Eight
//! metal boots showed how little that leaves. Each produced exactly three
//! heartbeats: two while userland was still coming up, then nothing at all for
//! between 14 s and 102 s, then one final line at `passes=1/8` in the same
//! millisecond as the boot's first keypress. After ~1.8 s every CPU had run a
//! pass, found no work and no deadline, stopped its LAPIC timer and halted —
//! and a halted CPU does not run the idle loop. The instrument was blind at
//! exactly the job it was built for: a healthy quiescent machine and a dead one
//! logged the same nothing.
//!
//! `diag-tick` is the fix and it belongs to the build rather than to this
//! module: it caps how long a CPU may sleep, so every CPU reaches a pass two or
//! three times per line whether or not the machine has work. That is what makes
//! the field worth printing — **a clear bit now means that CPU stopped**, not
//! that it had nothing to do, and the shape of the end discriminates a local
//! cause spreading (the mask thins CPU by CPU) from a global one (full to
//! nothing between two lines).
//!
//! # `ran=`, and why a queue depth could not have served
//!
//! `alive=` answers *is this CPU still running*, and on its own that is only
//! half of what a freeze is. A machine whose timers fire and whose CPUs take
//! passes but which never wakes the task that should run reads `alive=8/8`
//! forever while being, to its owner, dead. Three metal freezes now have three
//! different triggers — a process reaching its first instruction at 1.36 s, a
//! keypress at 86.9 s, a stream's first DMA at 3.8 s — and without a second
//! field all three would read as "heartbeats stopped at T", which says when and
//! never which.
//!
//! So `ran=` counts **tasks switched onto a CPU** since the previous line,
//! machine-wide. Two signatures that were one:
//!
//! - the line stops → nothing is scheduling; the machine stopped.
//! - the line continues with `ran=0` → the machine is scheduling and running
//!   nothing. That is a lost wakeup, or a userland that has stopped asking.
//!
//! **A sampled queue depth cannot do this and it is worth saying why**, because
//! it is the obvious design and it is wrong: a woken task is dispatched within
//! microseconds, so `ready=` sampled four times a second reads 0 on a healthy
//! machine and 0 on a dead one. The signal is a rate, so the instrument has to
//! be a counter.
//!
//! What `ran=0` does **not** mean on its own: a machine with genuinely nothing
//! to do also runs nothing. It is diagnostic because the laptop's desktop always
//! has something — the compositor wakes about twice a second to blink a cursor,
//! and every one of those is a dispatch — so a run of `ran=0` there is a
//! machine that has stopped doing what it was doing. Cross-check it against the
//! i8042 counter line, which says whether input was arriving meanwhile.
//!
//! # What it is evidence of, stated exactly
//!
//! A set bit says: that CPU took an interrupt, returned from `hlt`, and reached
//! the top of a scheduler pass. The next tick is armed by the timer stub in
//! assembly before any Rust runs, so one fire arms the next and the chain
//! breaks only where a CPU stops taking interrupts — which is the thing being
//! measured, not a step in measuring it.
//!
//! The hole it does **not** close: if every CPU's LAPIC timer stopped at once —
//! a C-state that parks the APIC timer, an SMI storm — the log would go silent
//! and read as death. The kernel only ever executes `hlt`, never `MWAIT`, and
//! programs no C-state MSR, so the timers should keep counting; but the laptop's
//! firmware is not ours. So a log that stops means *the machine stopped taking
//! timer interrupts*, which is weaker than *the machine died* and should be
//! written down as the weaker claim. `gap=` is what tells the two apart after
//! the fact: a machine that went quiet and came back says so on the line that
//! resumes.
//!
//! # Where it runs
//!
//! [`poll`] is called from `sched::driver::idle_loop`. It used to sit
//! immediately before `log_file::poll` so its line was flushed by the very next
//! statement, with the pre-halt recheck keeping the CPU awake until it was.
//! **Neither exists since log architecture L6**, and the placement needs
//! neither: a heartbeat is an ordinary record now, so `emit` posts `klogd`'s
//! wake at the commit and the halt is refused by the doorbell like any other
//! runnable task's. No second flush mechanism, and nothing here waits on a
//! lock: a heartbeat that could block would be a diagnostic that stops for the
//! reason it exists to report. The one
//! lock in reach is the I/O APIC topology, behind `i8042::report_line`'s
//! `try_lock`, which prints `rte=busy` rather than waiting.
//!
//! # The line beside it
//!
//! `alive=` and `ran=` answer *is the machine running* and *is it running
//! anything*. On the laptop they leave one question they cannot reach: a desktop
//! that is alive, has nothing to do and never will again, because the one
//! channel that could give it something has stopped. Four boots of 2026-08-07
//! end at the same `spawn:` line with every CPU quiescent, and a fifth had no
//! keyboard at all by the driver's own fail-closed decision — the same file
//! either way. So [`crate::drivers::i8042::report_line`] prints the state of
//! the pin beside every heartbeat: the controller's status byte and both
//! redirection entries, raw. `alive=8/8 ran=0` above `status=0x15` is a
//! controller holding a byte nobody will ever read; above a masked entry it is
//! a line that got switched off; above a clean one with the counters flat it is
//! a machine whose EC has stopped talking, and this kernel is out of it.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Four lines a second, about 60 bytes each, each of which `/bin/logd` writes
//! and `fsync`s — a device cache flush of whatever `/log` sits on. Against its
//! 1 MiB rotation that is a new part roughly every 70 minutes and sixteen kept, so a diagnostic
//! session of any length anyone will sit through fits. **That is a diagnostic
//! budget and not a shipping one**, which is why the shipping kernel does not
//! carry this module at all — and with `diag-tick` under it, the instrument is
//! no longer a passive observer of the boot it is watching.
