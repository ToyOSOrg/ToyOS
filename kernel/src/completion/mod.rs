//! One completion primitive: a record, an inbox, and a watch a waiter lends to
//! the object it is waiting on.
//!
//! The claim the whole design rests on is that **every wait in this kernel is
//! "a record in an inbox"** — so the park-time recheck is one predicate with
//! no source named in it, and a new
//! wait source cannot re-open the lost-wake window because it has no way to add
//! a second predicate.
//!
//! **[`Inbox::has_record`] is the park predicate.** [`wait_inner`] rechecks it
//! and nothing else, a park registers on the *thread's own* queue, and no queue
//! in the kernel is woken as a queue.
//!
//! **Which subjects exist here.** All of them. The four device watches
//! (`waitqs::{KEYBOARD, MOUSE, NETWORK, AUDIO}`), both ends of a pipe, the port
//! acceptor, the process and thread objects, the inbox ring, the futex bucket,
//! and a thread's own watch for the waits whose end is a deadline.
//!
//! **No registry, and no id.** A [`Subject`] is a borrowed reference to the
//! object being waited on, so a destroyed subject cannot be named and the core
//! maps no id to any object — structurally, not by discipline. A post is
//! a walk of one object's own list under its own leaf lock, which is the shape
//! `sched::waitqs` already has and which deletes the 128-core sharding risk a
//! global `CORE` lock would have had.
//!
//! **The cost, counted rather than asserted.** A post to a subject nobody is
//! armed on is *one relaxed load* and no lock at all — the same trick the log's
//! `signal_after_commit` uses, and the reason the record path has no
//! read-modify-write on it. A post that finds a waiter costs one `Lock` acquire
//! plus a plain store per waiter. An arm costs one `Arc` clone and one `Lock`
//! acquire; a disarm the same.
//!
//! **A killed task runs its own unwind and drops its [`Armed`] on the way
//! out.** The `Arc<TaskHandle>` a watcher holds stays anyway, because it is what
//! makes "rare" not have to be "never": an abandoned arm is then a bounded,
//! census-visible leak, where a raw pointer would be a use-after-free.
