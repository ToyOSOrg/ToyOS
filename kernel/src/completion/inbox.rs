//! The record, and the bounded ring a waiter owns.
//!
//! **Not the same `Inbox` as [`object::inbox`](crate::object::inbox).** That
//! one is the counted reference a process holds to the shared-memory
//! submission/completion pair `SYS_INBOX_SETUP` installs; this one is a
//! *task's* own bounded record ring, minted at spawn and never named by a
//! handle. The two are unrelated; a later chunk converges them.
//!
//! **This file is compiled a second time by `kernel-loom`**, so it may name
//! only what that crate supplies: the atomics, the cell, `toyos_abi`'s error
//! type and `crate::time` — which is why `Subject`, `Watch` and `arm` live one
//! level up in `mod.rs`, where they may name pipe ends and device claims. x86's
//! TSO gives every load acquire and every store release semantics, so a missing
//! edge here is invisible to every guest test; loom is the only instrument in
//! the tree that can see one, and ARM64 is planned.
//!
//! **The ordering, in one sentence.** A poster writes the slot and *then*
//! publishes `tail` with a release; a taker reads `tail` with an acquire and
//! only then reads the slot. That pair is the whole of the record's
//! publication, and `kernel-loom/tests/inbox.rs` is what proves it — with the
//! release removed, the model must red.
//!
//! **No read-modify-write on the post path, and that is a measured
//! constraint.** One `fetch_add` per log line was measured at 350 ms of boot
//! under TCG, because QEMU cannot always emit an inline host atomic for a guest
//! RMW and leaves the translation block to run it exclusively. So `tail` is a
//! plain load and a plain store made under the lock the poster already holds
//! (§16.2 rule 1), `head` is the same in the taker's hand, and the overflow
//! count is a load and a store rather than an increment. What makes the plain
//! stores sound is stated as an invariant and asserted at the arm:
//!
//! - **One poster at a time, and the mechanism is the subject's leaf lock.**
//!   Every post to a subject walks its watch list under that lock, so the
//!   posters to one inbox are serialized by construction. A producer that
//!   cannot take a lock therefore cannot use [`Inbox::post`] at all, and has
//!   [`Inbox::signal`] instead.
//! - **One taker, ever.** The inbox belongs to one task and only that task
//!   takes from it.
//!
//! **The mechanism is the lock and never the arm.** An inbox armed on exactly
//! one subject still admits a producer that takes no lock — the machine's log
//! is one — and two CPUs inside [`Inbox::post`] on one `UnsafeCell<Record>` is
//! undefined behaviour rather than a lost record.
//!
//! The two read-modify-writes in the file are both flags, both on the *taker's*
//! side of a word both sides write: the overflow notice and the signal. Neither
//! can be a load and a store, and a lost one is a lost wake rather than a lost
//! record.
