//! Per-CPU IRQ event records, generalizing the audio completion pattern to
//! every MSI-X source: the ISR records the IRQ-time timestamp on the CPU that
//! took the interrupt and sets `need_resched`; that CPU's next scheduler entry
//! (`sched::driver::drain_irqs`) consumes the record and converts it into
//! waiter wakes, inbox completions, or controller polls. The audio DATA path
//! (per-completion `(mask, timestamp)` records read by soundd) lives in
//! the sound stubs and is unrelated — this module only drives *scheduling* off
//! IRQs.
//!
//! Shape: one timestamp slot per `(cpu, source)` instead of a record queue.
//! Consumers re-derive device state at drain time (virtio used rings, xHCI
//! event ring), so back-to-back IRQs coalesce into one record and overflow
//! has no representation — the same resolution the spec applies to mailbox
//! messages (B8). The slot keeps the EARLIEST undrained timestamp, so the
//! traced latency honestly covers the oldest unserviced interrupt.
//!
//! Concurrency contract: every function indexes by `percpu::cpu_id()`, so
//! the API cannot express a cross-CPU access — all traffic on a CPU's slots
//! is same-CPU. Producers are MSI-X ISRs running with IF=0 (their
//! load-then-store pair cannot interleave with a consumer on the same CPU);
//! consumers are thread/timer contexts whose slot access is a single atomic
//! instruction (cannot be torn by an interrupting ISR). Relaxed ordering is
//! therefore sufficient everywhere: same-CPU accesses are program-ordered,
//! and there is no remote observer to publish to. Any future cross-CPU
//! consumer needs a redesign (swap-based publish), not stronger orderings.
