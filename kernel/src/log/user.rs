//! `SYS_LOG_READ`, and the readiness source a reader with nothing to read arms

//!
//! **The kernel keeps no per-reader state.** A cursor is a caller's own eight
//! sequence numbers and a loss count, in the caller's own memory; this file
//! copies it in, walks [`drain_ordered`] with it, copies whole records out and
//! copies the cursor back. There is no object, no handle lifecycle, nothing to
//! leak or go stale, and a second reader costs nothing — the stream is not
//! consumed, so `/bin/logd` and a `log-follow` tool coexist with no
//! coordination.
//!
//! **Reading the whole machine's log is authority**, so it rides
//! [`Rights::LOG`] on a `SysCap` rather than being ambient: every record every
//! CPU wrote is every process's business and no process's right by default.
