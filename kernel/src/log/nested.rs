//! An interrupt that logs, landing inside another `emit` — at one of two points
//! of the window, and the point is which actuator is armed.
//!
//! **The case loom cannot express.** Loom models threads, not CPU flags and not
//! strict LIFO reentrancy on one CPU, so §2.4's fourth property — that a nested
//! writer cannot collide with the writer it interrupted — has no model. Nothing
//! on the host can stage it either: there is no injection that interrupts a
//! kernel between two instructions of one function.
//!
//! **The stimulus is a self-IPI sent from inside `emit` itself**, so when it
//! arrives is a property of the flags and of nothing else. With §2.3a's bracket
//! it is pending across the whole reservation and body copy and is delivered
//! the instant the guard drops; without the bracket it lands where it was sent.
//!
//! `log-nested-emit` sends it from halfway through the body copy: the burst then
//! commits a whole newer generation into the slot the interrupted writer is
//! standing in, and the resumed writer overwrites a record that has already been
//! published. **That corruption is invisible to every reader in the machine**:
//! the resumed writer republishes the *previous* generation's number, which is
//! exactly what a slot whose writer has not published yet looks like, and
//! `Shard::oldest_readable` has already moved past the record it destroyed.
//! What it costs is one record and a stalled shard, neither distinguishable
//! from the ring's declared drop-oldest policy.
//!
//! `log-nested-reserve` sends it from **between the shard-pointer read and the
//! unlocked `xadd`** — the window §2.3a's bracket names first — and that one is
//! observable, because the two orders a shard has stop being the same order.
//! `emit` stamps `at_ns` before it reserves, so a handler that logs from inside
//! that window takes the *lower* sequence numbers and carries the *later*
//! timestamps, and the interrupted producer's own record lands above them with a
//! timestamp from before any of them. `read.rs`'s `Descent::advance` is written
//! against exactly that not happening, and `test-runner`'s log gate refuses a
//! shard whose `at_ns` descends.
//!
//! **It runs on a kernel thread and not in the syscall that arms it**, and that
//! is the difference between a gate and a tautology: `IF` is clear for the whole
//! of every syscall, so a record emitted from one is bracketed whether or not
//! the guard exists, and removing the guard would change nothing. A kernel
//! thread's body runs with `IF` set, which is where the guard is the only thing
//! holding the interrupt off.

/// Which producer the burst's records declare themselves as.
///
/// **Past what any storm thread can be**, so the reader's per-producer ledger
/// takes them through exactly the same checks as a storm's — same text, same
/// regeneration, same strictly-increasing indices — with no second parser on
/// either side.
