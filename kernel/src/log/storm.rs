//! `log-storm`: every CPU emitting patterned records at once, so a reader can
//! check a conservation law over them.
//!
//! **Nothing else can reach this.** A real workload's record rate is whatever
//! the kernel happens to log, which is a handful of lines a second and cannot
//! be made to saturate a shard however long a test waits — and the property
//! under test is exactly what happens when producers outrun the one reader and
//! the ring starts dropping.
//!
//! **Kernel threads at preempt depth 0 with `IF` set, one per shard**, so the
//! records really are written by every CPU at once and through the shipped
//! `emit`, the shipped reservation and the shipped publication. *One per
//! shard* is how many are spawned and not where they land — nothing in this
//! kernel pins a task to a CPU, and [`body`] says what that costs the gate.
//!
//! **What this workload cannot reach, measured rather than assumed**: a
//! producer that moves between CPUs *mid-storm*. A Ring 0 loop that takes no
//! lock is never preempted here — `need_resched` is polled by `preempt::enable`
//! and by the Ring 3 exit, and this loop reaches neither — and a producer that
//! parks and is woken is placed back on the CPU it left. Three shapes were
//! measured on 2026-08-15 at `--smp 8`: one thread per shard, two threads per
//! shard with an explicit `yield_now` every sixteen records, and two per shard
//! parking for 50 µs every sixteen. All three reported **0 of 8 (and 0 of 16)
//! producers with records on a second shard**. That is not bad luck and no
//! workload improves on it: nothing in this kernel switches a Ring 0 context
//! out between two instructions, so no producer can be moved off its CPU inside
//! the reservation window at any rate (`sched::kthread`'s header states the
//! rule; this is the measurement under it).
//! `log-nested-reserve`'s gate reaches that window instead, on one CPU, where
//! an interrupt is a stimulus a test can actually aim.
//!
//! **It starts when the reader does.** The storm exists to race a reader, so
//! arming it at boot would spend it before `test-runner` had opened a cursor;
//! the first `SYS_LOG_READ` of the boot is what spawns the threads, which makes
//! the overlap a property of the mechanism instead of of the harness's timing.
