//! halted — and a reader that waits for it never reaches the line that says
//! why.
//!
//! [`drain_ordered`] is `klogd`'s and `SYS_LOG_READ`'s: in sequence order per
//! shard, oldest first, stopping a shard at its first uncommitted
//! record. On a live machine that stop is one bounded 1 KiB publication long;
//! on a dying one it can be forever, which is exactly why the machine that is
//! halting uses the other function instead.
//!
//! **Two names rather than one with a flag**, because each is correct for its
//! caller and neither is a mode of the other.
