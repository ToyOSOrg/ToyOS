//! The kernel's console sink, the two drain modes, and `klogd`.
//!
//! One thread where every idle CPU used to drain, and that is a reduction this
//! design accepts and names. Three
//! things bound it: boot does not need a thread at all, the panic and shutdown
//! paths drain inline and never depend on `klogd` being schedulable, and
//! **`klogd`'s own death is not survivable quietly** — its row in
//! `sched::kthread` is [`OnPanic::Halt`], because a machine whose only console
//! drainer has been killed goes silent with nothing left able to say so.
//!
//! **Its death is survivable by design, which is why its panic may not be.**
//! Records keep committing into the shards whatever happens here: the oldest
//! are dropped and counted, `lost` derives from `head` and `next` rather than
//! from a counter, and `snapshot_committed` reads the shards directly — so the
//! panic path is unaffected by `klogd` being gone. What is lost is the live
//! console, which is exactly the thing nothing else can report.
//!
//! **[`Drain::Inline`] and [`Drain::Thread`] are phases and not fallbacks.**
//! Exactly one is active, the transition is a single statement — [`start`] —
//! and there is no second flag to disagree with the first about which one the
//! machine is in: `Drain::Inline` *is* [`KLOGD`] being null.
