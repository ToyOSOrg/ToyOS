//! Linux-style deferred preemption primitives.
//!
//! Two per-CPU words drive the model (defined in `arch::percpu::PerCpu`):
//!   - `preempt_count` @ gs:[240] — incremented by every IRQ entry and by
//!     `disable()`. Read-modify-writes are `lock`-prefixed because both kernel
//!     code and IRQ entries mutate it on the same CPU; `set_count`'s plain
//!     store needs no prefix (a naturally aligned 32-bit store, and a same-CPU
//!     IRQ cannot land inside one instruction).
//!   - `need_resched` @ gs:[244] — set by the timer ISR (and future wake
//!     paths), cleared by the deferred-preempt epilogue. Single-byte stores
//!     are naturally atomic on x86 — no `lock` prefix needed.
//!
//! When `enable()` drops the count to zero AND `need_resched` is set, the
//! slow path runs `scheduler::do_preempt()` to actually yield.
//!
//! Every GS-relative access in this file goes through `arch::percpu::gs`'s
//! `const`-generic primitives — `read_u32`, `write_u32`, `read_u8`,
//! `write_u8_imm`, `lock_inc_u32`, `lock_dec_u32` — rather than a hand-written
//! `asm!` string per accessor. The offset is a `const` operand, so each still
//! assembles to the immediate-displacement form (`lock addl $1, %gs:240`) the
//! entry stubs in `arch::syscall` and `arch::idt` open and close the same count
//! with. **They live in `arch::percpu` and not here**: that module declares
//! `PerCpu`, asserts every offset against the number the assembly hardcodes, and
//! reaches the same fields itself — this file had a second copy of both the
//! primitives and the three offsets, and a `gs:` string at the crate root is
//! also x86 in a file that is not `arch/`.
//!
//! The word is per-CPU but the depth it holds belongs to the running *context*,
//! so `Hw::switch` swaps it with the incoming context's saved depth. Without
//! that swap the count is not conserved across a switch and its absolute value
//! means nothing — which `scheduler.rs`'s preempt-depth baselines rest on.
