//! The unit that decides what a device may reach.
//!
//! **This module is the built half**: the machine's units are inventoried,
//! every enumerated PCI function is given a context entry naming one
//! identity-mapped domain, and translation is turned on. Interrupt remapping,
//! per-driver domains and mapping, and refusing a machine with no usable unit
//! are not built — `issues/kernel/the-iommu-stops-at-translation.md` is the
//! entry. The refusal is sequenced last on purpose, because one landed before
//! the first userspace driver has moved costs every machine and protects
//! nothing.
//!
//! So this module *refuses nothing*. Every condition that a machine with no
//! usable unit would one day be refused on — no unit declared by firmware or
//! none decodable, no interrupt remapping, no implemented address width, no
//! 2 MiB pages, no queued invalidation — is reported here as a line naming the
//! register it decided on, and the boot continues: a unit this kernel cannot
//! program is left off rather than made into a halt. The messages themselves
//! are not written yet either: a line saying "ToyOS requires one" on a kernel
//! that boots happily without one is a comment that lies about its own code.
//!
//! **Intel's register layout may not leak into the names above `vtd/`.**
//! Everything in this file is stated in terms an ARM SMMU also answers, so a
//! second backend drops in without the seam moving; nothing here says `Dmar`,
//! `Sagaw` or `SourceId`.
//!
//! What this stage deliberately does *not* add, so the per-driver domain work
//! does not have to unpick it: a `DomainId`, a `DmaPerm`, an `IommuError` and a
//! `trait Iommu`. There is one domain on this machine and one backend, so each
//! would be a type with a single value and a single implementor — a dead
//! abstraction, and the seam is not the code that would name it.

// Every `unsafe` block under `iommu::` has either stopped existing or carries a
// `SAFETY:` saying why it could not — the reduction-before-documentation sweep
// `issues/build/clippy-has-never-run-here.md` records. `host-tests.yml`'s two
// kernel clippy invocations both run with `-D warnings`, so `warn` here is what
// gates: a new undocumented block anywhere in this module tree fails CI.
