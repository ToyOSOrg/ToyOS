//! Queued invalidation: telling the unit that what it cached is no longer what
//! memory says.
//!
//! **This is synchronous** — a descriptor followed by an Invalidation Wait
//! descriptor with a status write, polled to completion — and the wait is
//! bounded by a named constant whose expiry is a panic. A unit that will not
//! acknowledge an invalidation has left the kernel unable to say what a device
//! can reach, and there is no safe way to continue from that.
//!
//! A unit without `ECAP.QI` could be served through `CCMD_REG` and
//! `IOTLB_REG` instead, which is correct and slower. No such register path is
//! written here: every unit anyone can boot has queued invalidation, so that
//! path would be an arm no machine in reach executes. A unit that lacks it
//! is left unprogrammed and says so, which is the eventual refusal one stage
//! early and costs that machine nothing it has today.
