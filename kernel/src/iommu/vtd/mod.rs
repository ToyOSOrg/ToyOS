//! Intel VT-d. Every register layout and every Intel name in this subsystem is
//! at or below this module, by rule: nothing above `vtd/` may say `Dmar`,
//! `Sagaw` or `SourceId`.
//!
//! What is built: the units are found, their capabilities decoded and
//! described, every enumerated PCI function given a context entry naming one
//! identity-mapped domain, and translation turned on. Nothing is *refused*:
//! every observation that will one day refuse a machine appears here as a line
//! naming the register value it decided on, and a unit this kernel cannot

//!
//! Register offsets, and the field positions inside `CAP` and `ECAP`, come

//! difference. A decode reading the wrong bits cannot track a register it is
//! not looking at — and from I2 on, a unit programmed through the wrong offset
//! does not translate at all, which every profile in the suite now depends on.
