//! The `DMAR` table: what firmware says about this machine's remapping units.
//!
//! Firmware bytes are untrusted input, and `drivers::acpi`'s module doc
//! already states what follows: nothing on this path panics for any input, and
//! a table that cannot be believed is a refusal naming what it was refused on.
//! Every read here goes through [`Table::field`], whose bound is the length
//! `find_table` validated and checksummed once.
//!
//! The walk is `parse_madt`'s, deliberately and not by coincidence: an entry
//! declaring zero length, or a length running past the list that holds it,
//! ends it. There is no way to resynchronise a self-describing list that lied
//! about an element's size, and a walk that tries is a walk over whatever
//! follows. The same rule applies one level down, where a device scope is
//! bounded by its own structure rather than by the table.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates and nothing here is stored. A [`Dmar`] is a copy of
//! a validated `(base, len)` pair and every structure in it is an offset into
//! that; the table stays in the direct map where firmware left it. That keeps
//! this stage honest — I1 has no consumer for an inventory, and a `Vec` built
//! for a reader that does not exist yet is state nobody can check.
