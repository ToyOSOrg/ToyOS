// Page tables and address spaces.
//
// The only code that writes page table entries. Manages the kernel direct map
// (all physical memory at PHYS_OFFSET) and per-process user address spaces.
//
// **An invalidation is derived from the entry that was replaced, never chosen
// by the caller.** Every write into a paging structure the hardware may already
// be walking goes through `PageTablePage::write`, `write_pde` — the writer every
// leaf-mapping path uses — or `widen`, each of which returns the `Owed` their
// prior value implies; `Owed` is `#[must_use]` and the three ways to end one are
// the three answers there are. The rule is the SDM's:
// a not-present entry creates no TLB entry and no paging-structure-cache entry
// (Vol. 3A §4.10.2.3), so a write over one can leave nothing stale and an
// `invlpg` there is pure cost — §4.10.4.3 says so as a permission. A write over
// a present entry is invalidated whatever the caller believes, because a missing
// invalidation is silent and a redundant one is only slow.
//
// **What is discharged here reaches this CPU and no other.** Telling the rest of
// the machine is `arch::tlb::shootdown`, and it stays the caller's: which other
// CPUs hold a translation is not knowable from the entry.
//
// **Every user mapping states one `Prot`, and W^X is the variant that does not
// exist.** There is no writable-and-executable page a call site can ask for.
// `EFER.NXE` is `arch::control_regs`' to declare; without it bit 63 would be
// reserved rather than a permission, and every `Prot::ReadWrite` would fault.
//
// **User mappings are 2 MiB except where a program's own segments forbid it.**
// One binary has one window where `.text` ends and `.data` begins, and
// `map_window` splits exactly that window into 4 KiB entries over the same
// frame — `WindowProt` carries the measurement that ruled out the alternatives.
// A split is one-way: nothing coalesces a window back, and the page table lives
// in `children` until the address space does.
//
// **A window a fault filled is claimed under the lock that installs it.** The
// demand pager fills 2 MiB with this address space unlocked, so the "is it
// mapped?" it asked before filling is stale by the whole fill and two threads of
// one process both pass it. `map_window_if_absent` is where that question is
// asked the second time, in the same critical section as the write it decides,
// and the loser's frame is dropped rather than installed over the winner's — a
// second install would leave the first thread's CPU holding a translation
// nothing else can see, because what `write_pde` derives reaches this CPU alone.
//
// **No mapping in this kernel is global.** There is no `PAGE_GLOBAL` and
// `CR4.PGE` is not in `arch::control_regs`'s declaration, which is what makes
// the single-address forms complete here: INVPCID type 0 and INVLPG both leave
// global translations alone. Adding PGE means revisiting every `discharge`.
//
// **The tagged branches are not exercised on the dev host.** Its QEMU is
// `-cpu qemu64`, which offers no PCID, so `pcid_active()` is false and a guest
// there boots holding `cr4=0x00310668`. Only a KVM runner with `-cpu host`
// executes an `INVPCID` at all, so what answers for those branches is the
// derivation and not the harness.
