/// Every method here runs inside `KernelAllocator`'s `dlmalloc.lock()`, in the
/// middle of dlmalloc mutating its own chunk and segment lists, and the kernel
/// does not unwind — so a panic from in here abandons the heap in whatever
/// state it was in, with the lock held forever. The CPU that recovers from
/// that panic then spins `Lock::lock` on its next `alloc` or `free`, and the
/// machine goes quiet.
///
/// So a size this source cannot back is a `null`, not an assert: dlmalloc
/// hands the null back to the caller with its structures consistent, the lock
/// drops, and whatever the caller does about it — `handle_alloc_error`, an
/// `Option` — happens outside. The fail-fast for a caller asking the heap for
/// page-scale memory is [`MAX_HEAP_ALLOC`], checked in `KernelAllocator::alloc`
/// *before* the lock is taken.
///
/// `pmm::alloc_page` is the only thing reached from here, and it is
/// panic-free by the same rule.

// the `(ptr, size)` pair it was given. `alloc` here always answers in whole

// only ever reconstructs a page `pmm` actually handed out at that address —
// `free` is what returns it, never a bare drop. `remap`/`free_part`/
// `can_release_part` all refuse (null or `false`), so dlmalloc can never ask

/// The heap tripwire: a band of known bytes on each side of every allocation,

///
/// **It exists because the allocator's own answer was too expensive.**
/// `dlmalloc` carries Doug Lea's full consistency checker behind its `debug`
/// cargo feature — `check_malloc_state` walks all 32 smallbins, all 32
/// treebins and every chunk of every segment at the head of *every* `malloc`
/// and `free`. That is the right oracle at the wrong price: this heap runs to
/// several MiB by the end of boot, so the walk is O(heap) per allocation and a
/// TCG guest carrying it does not finish a boot in a storm's lifetime. The
/// bands below cost two writes per allocation and two reads per free, and they
/// answer the question this class actually poses — *is something writing
/// outside an allocation it owns* — rather than the one the checker answers,
/// which is whether the free lists still hang together afterwards.
///
/// What each side catches:
///
/// * The **tail** catches an overrun off the end. 32 bytes, which is
///   `dlmalloc`'s `min_chunk_size` on x86-64, so a near miss lands here and not
///   in the next chunk's header where it would be indistinguishable from
///   allocator state.
/// * The **head** catches an underrun, and it is as wide as the request's
///   alignment. That is not a rounding accident: a task's kernel stack is
///   `OwnedAlloc::new(KERNEL_STACK_SIZE, 4096)`, so under this feature it gets
///   **4096 bytes of head band**, and a kernel stack that walks off its own
///   bottom writes into that band instead of into the neighbouring chunk. It is
///   the guard page `arch::percpu` gives every *idle* stack, in the one form
///   available to an allocation that comes out of the heap.
///
/// Neither band is swept — there is no registry of live allocations to sweep —
/// so a band is read at `dealloc`, which is late, and by [`check_live`] at
/// whatever site cares, which is not. `sched::driver`'s pass reads the running
/// task's bands every pass, which is the both-ends pattern `sched-tripwire`
/// established: a band broken at the entry to a pass was broken before that
/// pass ran a statement.
///
/// **The one behaviour it changes.** A request within `head + TAIL` bytes of
/// `MAX_HEAP_ALLOC` fits the ceiling and its banded form does not, so it is
/// answered `null` here and would have succeeded without the feature.
/// `OwnedAlloc::new` hands that back as `None`; a `Vec` would reach
/// `handle_alloc_error`. This is a diagnostic build and the window is 4 KiB
/// wide at the very top of a 2 MiB ceiling, so it is recorded rather than
/// papered over.
