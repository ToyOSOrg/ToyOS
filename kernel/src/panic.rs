//! What a crashing CPU may touch before it trusts the machine, and the evidence
//! it leaves when it has nowhere left to report.
//!
//! Two dead ends end a crash with no report of their own. The **reentry guard**
//! fires when the panic *report* panics, and the **`DOUBLE PANIC`** arm fires
//! when a panic arrives on a CPU that is already inside a fault or a report.
//! Without what follows, the one class of crash that is by definition two bugs
//! deep is the one class that leaves no evidence at all — a `DOUBLE PANIC` or a
//! `PANIC REENTRY: CPU halted` says neither what the first crash was, nor where
//! (`issues/panic-path/a-double-panic-at-boots-edge-says-nothing-but-its-name.md`).
//!
//! **The evidence is copied at the moment the first crash begins, before
//! anything is printed.** [`record_panic`] runs as the first statement of the
//! panic handler and [`record_fault`] as the first statement of
//! `fatal_exception` after the state swap — both ahead of every formatter, every
//! lock and every device this kernel has. What they do is a bounded byte copy
//! into a static reserved when the image was linked: no allocation, no lock, no
//! `core::fmt`, no page that can be absent, and nothing that can itself panic.
//! Everything downstream of them may die without taking the report with it,
//! which is the whole property — a mechanism that captured the first crash
//! *while* reporting it would be a mechanism whose failure mode is this issue.
//!
//! **What it deliberately does not attempt.** No unwinding, and no second
//! formatting pass: the message is taken from
//! [`core::panic::PanicMessage::as_str`], which is `Some` exactly when the panic
//! carries a literal and needs no runtime formatting, and is otherwise left out
//! by name. Running `core::fmt` here would put a `Display` impl — free to lock,
//! to allocate and to panic — inside the one mechanism whose value is that it
//! cannot fail; the formatted text is `crash_report`'s job and reaches the
//! record ring one instruction later. So `expect("…")` and `assert_eq!` leave a
//! location and no message, and `panic!("…")`, `assert!` and `unwrap()` leave
//! both.
//!
//! **The slot holds this CPU's *first* unfinished crash.** [`claim`] is a
//! compare-exchange from `None`, so the second crash — the one that is doing the
//! reporting, and whose `PanicInfo` is live on its own stack — never overwrites
//! the first. [`forget`] releases it wherever a CPU declares itself normal
//! again, so a *recovered* panic cannot be reported an hour later as somebody
//! else's first event. The demand-paging return does not release it and does not
//! need to: nothing that captures can reach that path without passing one of
//! [`forget`]'s three call sites, and [`apic_id`] is a `CPUID` — not a thing to
//! put on the fault path this kernel takes millions of.
//!
//! **Where the report goes.** [`last_words`] streams straight to the 16550
//! through `serial::panic_raw`: no lock, no ring, no percpu, bounded per byte.
//! That is the one channel a dead end may use, because the guard the log's
//! console drain takes is exactly what the first crash may be holding — and a
//! second panic that arrives while the first holds it is one plausible way a
//! first panic becomes a double. The `DOUBLE PANIC` arm *also* says it as a
//! record, because that is the only channel a machine with no serial port has:
//! the on-screen panel and the virtio-console both read records. Raw first, so
//! a wedge in the record path costs the second copy and never the first. On a
//! UART-only machine the report therefore arrives twice, which is the same
//! trade `log::console::drain_bypassed` already makes: twice beats never on a
//! machine that is halting.
//!
//! The two renderings differ on purpose — the raw one carries APIC ids and hex,
//! the record is the readable line a panel shows — and they are written ten
//! lines apart in one function so they cannot drift into disagreeing about the
//! evidence.
