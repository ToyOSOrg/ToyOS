//! The one bracket every transition out of Ring 3 uses.
//!
//! **The invariant**: a transition out of Ring 3 that can reach another task
//! must save and restore **the whole** user machine state, and restore it as
//! the transition's last act before returning to Ring 3 — after any point at
//! which the task could have been switched. These macros are the only text in
//! the kernel naming an FP instruction, so "saved some of it" is not
//! expressible — there is nothing to say it with.
//!
//! **Contract.** [`save_user_state`] may be invoked at any stack alignment; it
//! leaves `rsp` aligned to [`UserFpState`]'s alignment, which is also what a
//! System V call taken after it needs. [`restore_user_state`] puts `rsp` back
//! exactly where the save found it. Between them `r11` is scratch: every entry
//! has already pushed it as part of its GPR save, and one that has not would
//! lose the user's `r11` regardless.
//!
//! **What it saves is everything this kernel permits to exist.** `CR4.OSXSAVE`
//! is set nowhere, so `XCR0` is 1 and `FXSAVE64` is complete rather than cheap.
//! Every user thread's x87 register file, control, status and tag words, XMM0-15
//! and `MXCSR` cross a ring transition intact — including a *pending unmasked
//! x87 exception*, which `FXSAVE64` carries across without raising it, so it
//! reaches only the task that caused it.
//!
//! **The area is sized by the type, at every site, without the site saying so.**
//! [`ring3_naked_asm`] appends the two `const` operands the templates name, so
//! there is nowhere to write a number. That is the whole of the AVX-512 guard:
//! `XCR0` is 1 today and `FXSAVE64` is therefore complete, and enabling any
//! further state component means [`UserFpState`] grows and every reservation
//! grows with it or the build stops. A comment saying the same thing would not.
