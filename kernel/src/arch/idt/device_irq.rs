//! Shared device interrupt entry.
//!
//! Every device vector (xHCI, virtio-net, virtio-sound over MSI-X; the i8042
//! on an I/O APIC pin) has the same obligations, so one asm shape serves all
//! of them: save the SysV scratch GPRs + rbp (the Rust handler can clobber
//! them — leaving any unsaved would leak kernel state into user regs on
//! iretq), bracket the handler with the percpu preempt count, and on return
//! to Ring 3 run the deferred-preempt epilogue. How the vector was delivered
//! makes no difference to any of that.
//!
//! Every handler publishes an `irq_ring` record and sets `need_resched`, so
//! the Ring 3 epilogue may context-switch — it therefore parks the user machine
//! state on this kernel stack across the call (`arch::entry`): other threads'
//! user code clobbers it, while kernel code itself is soft-float and never
//! touches it (hence no save around the handler call itself).
//!
//! IF stays 0 for the entire entry (interrupt gate; handlers never sti), so
//! `kernel_exit_to_user_check`'s IF=0-on-entry contract holds without an
//! explicit cli.

/// Define a naked device-interrupt entry point that calls `$handler` and runs
/// the deferred-preempt epilogue on the Ring 3 return path.
