// DESIGN RULE: crash_report and everything it calls must be panic-free.
// No unwrap/expect/[], no allocation, no blocking locks. try_lock only.
// log!() is verified panic-free (let _ = write!(), serial::write is direct outb).
// Symbol resolution is lock-free (AtomicPtr, linear scan over static ELF data).
//
// "try_lock only" was not sufficient on its own, and the gap was not in this
// file. `Lock::try_lock` raises the preempt count on entry, and both its
// failure path and its guard's `Drop` lower it again — so on the pass that
// takes the count back to zero with `need_resched` set, `preempt::enable`
// dispatched `do_preempt` and the crash report reached the scheduler from
// inside a fault. `panic_console` had already refused `try_lock` for exactly
// this reason and said so in its own comment; the rest of the crash path kept
// using it, and two uses are still behind this one — the process table here,
// and `dump_crash_diagnostics`.
//
// **A symbol is no longer one of them.** `resolve_user_symbol` took the process
// table too, and a `try_lock` that must not wait is one that sometimes loses:
// what it lost was the faulting function's name, on a report that had already
// resolved the same address a line later. It reads the running task's own
// symbols now, with no lock in the path at all — `process`'s module header is
// the rule and `sched::driver::current_symbols` is the read.
//
// Fixed centrally rather than per call site: `preempt::enable` now declines
// the slow path while `PerCpu::fault_state` is non-zero. That is the honest
// place for it — a CPU inside a fault or panic report must not be rescheduled
// whatever it happens to call — and it covers uses this rule has not been
// applied to yet, which chasing call sites would not.

/// What a vector is called in a report.
///
/// Read by `crash_report_exception`, which has the frame in front of it, and by
