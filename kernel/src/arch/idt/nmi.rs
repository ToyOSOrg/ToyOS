//! Vector 2, and the only thing it is for: asking a CPU that will not answer a
//! kick where it is.
//!
//! An NMI is not maskable by `IF`, so it reaches a CPU spinning in a
//! cli-guarded loop — which a kick does not, and which is exactly the state
//! `sched::dump` cannot otherwise tell apart from a halted CPU whose IPI was
//! lost.
//!
//! **The handler does not log.** It cannot: the context it interrupts may hold
//! the log ring's lock, and an NMI that waits on a lock its own victim owns is
//! the deadlock this facility exists to diagnose. It stores `rip` in a
//! lock-free per-CPU slot and returns; the CPU that asked prints and symbolizes
//! it from ordinary context.
//!
//! No preempt-count bump and no exit-to-user check either. An NMI arrives
//! between arbitrary instructions, including inside the window where either of
//! those is half-updated, and this handler never reschedules — so the only
//! correct thing it can do to that state is nothing.
//!
//! # Why this gate has an IST, and what that costs
//!
//! "Between arbitrary instructions" includes the three of `arch::syscall`'s
//! entry that run at CPL 0 with `rsp` still pointing into the user's stack, and
//! the one between its `pop rsp` and its `sysretq`. A frame the CPU builds
//! there is a supervisor write to a user page: SMAP refuses it, the `#PF` lands
//! on the same stack, and the machine takes a `#DF` — measured on this tree with
//! `TF` in that window before the bit joined `IA32_FMASK`. An IST index is the
//! architecture's answer (SDM Vol. 3A §6.14.5): the CPU loads `rsp` from the TSS
//! before it pushes anything, whatever the interrupted context held.
//!
//! **The cost is that an IST stack is not re-entrant.** A second NMI entered
//! while the first is still on IST2 starts its frame at the same top and writes
//! over the first — the corruption Linux's nested-NMI machinery exists to
//! survive (`arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S`: the "NMI executing" variable and the
//! copied `iret` frame, which let its handler take faults and run `int3`
//! breakpoints). This kernel needs none of that, and the reason is a property of
//! *this* handler rather than a claim about NMIs in general:
//!
//! 1. **The architecture blocks NMI delivery from the moment one is delivered
//!    until the next `iretq`** (SDM Vol. 3A §6.7.1). So the only way to re-enter
//!    is an `iretq` executed before this handler is done with its stack.
//! 2. **This handler executes exactly one `iretq`, as its last instruction.**
//! 3. **It cannot fault, so it cannot reach anybody else's `iretq` either.**
//!    What it touches, in full: its own IST2 stack (a boot-time `alloc_zeroed`
//!    in the direct map, never freed); `gs:[…]`, whose base is this CPU's
//!    `PerCpu`, also a direct-map allocation; and, inside
//!    [`crate::sched::dump::note_nmi`], two `static` arrays in `.bss` indexed
//!    after a bounds check that returns early. Every one of those addresses is
//!    covered by a PML4 entry built before the first process existed and
//!    shallow-copied into every address space (`AddressSpace::new_user`), so no
//!    page walk from here can miss, whatever `CR3` holds. It takes no lock, makes
//!    no allocation, logs nothing, dereferences no user pointer and calls
//!    nothing that can panic.
//!
//! That is an argument, and an argument is not an observation — so the entry
//! below *checks* it. `PerCpu::nmi_active` is raised before the first push and
//! cleared before the `iretq`; an NMI that finds it already raised takes
//! [`nested_nmi`], which reports straight to the UART and halts the machine.
//! Silent corruption of the one diagnostic that answers a wedged CPU is worth
//! less than a machine that stops and says so.
//!
//! **Neither path here may `log!`, and the dying one no more than the ordinary
//! one** — the reason is the shard and not the severity, and it is the whole of
//! `src/sourcegate.rs`'s `nmi_does_not_log`.
//!
//! **What gates this, and what does not.** An NMI *arriving inside that window*
//! is staged by `syscall-window-nmi`, and how often it arrives there is the
//! accelerator's answer rather than the kernel's. Under TCG, QEMU checks for a
//! pending interrupt between translation blocks and `syscall` ends one, so the
//! dev host delivers 36 to 58 arrivals per 3,000, run after run. Under KVM the
//! injection happens at the next VM entry after the kick's exit, and **which
//! instruction that is depends on the host**: the hosted lane has measured both
//! **0 of 6,000** (run 32584121311, with thousands of the same NMIs arriving in
//! Ring 3, so the aim was right and the injection point was elsewhere) and
//! **64 of 64** (run 32587665835, every delivery landing on the entry's first
//! instruction until the storm stopped at its arrival ceiling). CI's guest lane
//! is KVM (`tests/CLAUDE.md`), so **"the window is exercised per pull request"
//! is a claim this tree may not make** — and neither is "KVM cannot reach it".
//! What holds on every host is the `nmi-without-ist` control, which takes this
//! gate's IST index off and double faults at `syscall_entry` with
//! `cr2 = rsp - 8`, and the compile-time assertion over `arch::idt`'s table that
//! vector 2 and vector 18 carry an index at all.
