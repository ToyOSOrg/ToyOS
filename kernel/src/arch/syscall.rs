/// Same contract as `sys_getcwd` and `sys_readdir`, and for the same reason.
/// This used to answer a too-small buffer with a bare `InvalidArgument` while
/// the ABI wrapper's doc comment claimed the required size was "encoded" in it
/// — a claim `SyscallError` cannot carry, so a caller had no way to size a
/// retry and no way to learn that was why it failed.
///
/// The answer is a byte length and never a module count: the records carry
/// packed path strings, so a count cannot size the buffer. Nothing is written
/// unless all of it fits, which makes an empty buffer a size query.
///
/// The record array is `buf[..records[0].path_offset]` — every module writes
/// its path after the last record, so the first module's `path_offset` is
/// where the array ends.
///
/// Every module holds address space for as long as it is loaded, so the count
/// is bounded by the process's own arena and the required length stays far
/// below the range `SyscallError` encodes — it can never be misread as one.
