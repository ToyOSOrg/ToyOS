//! The machine-wide TLB shootdown.
//!
//! `arch::idt::tlb` owns vector 0xFE's entry stub; this owns what the vector is
//! *for*. The protocol itself — the generation counter and the per-CPU
//! publication — is `crate::shootdown`, which has no hardware in it so that
//! `kernel-loom` can drive the real code.
//!
//! **A shootdown returns when every other CPU has flushed, not when the IPI has
//! been written.** Callers free on the far side of it, so an early return is a
//! use-after-free through a sibling's stale translation; and a sibling that
//! still calls a page write-back while this CPU has made it write-combining is
//! undefined by SDM Vol. 3A §11.12.4, which permits a machine to hang on it.
//!
//! ## The deadlock a synchronous shootdown opens, and why this one does not
//!
//! A target spinning with `IF` clear cannot take the IPI. An initiator that
//! waits for it while holding what it is spinning on never finishes.
//!
//! **`IF` is clear for the whole of every syscall** — `arch::syscall`'s
//! `MSR_FMASK` masks it on the `SYSCALL` gate and nothing sets it again before
//! `sysretq` — and every IDT gate is entered with it clear too. So the class is
//! not a window somebody could enumerate: it is every unmap-then-free the kernel
//! performs, since all of them are reached from a syscall or a fault, plus every
//! lock any handler takes.
//!
//! **So the target answers instead of the initiator abstaining.** `Lock::lock`'s
//! spin calls [`poll`] on every turn, and the initiator's own wait below calls
//! `Shootdown::wait_turn`, which answers before it asks — two CPUs that issue
//! concurrently each spin for the other, so each must be able to answer while
//! spinning. A flush is safe from anywhere — it takes no lock, allocates
//! nothing, and a CPU that flushes more often than asked is merely slower — so a
//! CPU that cannot take the interrupt acknowledges as promptly as one that did.
//! That closes the class structurally, for locks nobody has written yet as much
//! as for the ones in the tree today.
//!
//! What is left is an `IF=0` spin that is *not* a `Lock` and not this wait: a
//! driver waiting on a device register inside a handler. Those are latency, not
//! deadlock, because each carries its own deadline — but the deadline can be
//! seconds (xHCI inside `drain_irqs`), so [`ACK_TIMEOUT`] is set above the
//! largest of them and a CPU past it is named in a panic rather than waited for
//! forever.
