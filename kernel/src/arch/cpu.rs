//! One instruction each: the bottom of this kernel's x86-64 machine access.
//!
//! **Every `unsafe` block in this file is irreducible in the same way, and it is
//! the only reason they are all still here.** Each is one instruction that Rust
//! has no operation for — an MSR, a control register, a port, a TLB entry, a
//! flag — so there is no lower layer to push it into and no safe spelling to
//! prefer. What each block's own comment adds is the *instruction's* own
//! requirement: what makes it fault, and which half of that the function
//! signature above it discharges.
//!
//! The split between `pub fn` and `pub unsafe fn` here is that second half. A
//! function is `unsafe` when the caller can choose a value that breaks the
//! machine — `write_cr0`, `write_cr4`, `write_cr3`, `lidt`, `ltr`, `wbinvd`,
//! `wrmsr`, `outb`, `outw`, `wrfsbase` — and safe when it cannot.
//!
//! **Two wrappers take a caller-chosen value and are safe anyway, and each
//! argues it in its own doc comment rather than in a `SAFETY:` block.**
//! [`invlpg`] and [`invpcid`] *discard* translations, which is the direction
//! that cannot make an access unsound; keeping a stale entry is what would.
//! `invpcid`'s two faults are removed rather than argued away — the `#GP` on a
//! descriptor type above 3 is unrepresentable ([`Invpcid`]) and the `#UD` on a
//! CPU without the feature is an argument the caller can only get by asking
//! ([`PcidActive`]). [`inb`] is safe because a read has no value for a caller to
//! get wrong.
//!
//! **Where an `unsafe fn` here has a closed set of callers, the honest form is
//! one safe wrapper that discharges the choice, not an `unsafe` block apiece.**
//! `arch::apic::Reg` is that for the eighteen x2APIC `wrmsr` calls, and
//! `mm::paging::activate_kernel` is the pattern it follows. Where the set is not
//! closed — a port a device's firmware description names, an MSR that *is* the
//! machine's one declaration — the block sits at the call and its `SAFETY:`
//! says why that value is the right one.
