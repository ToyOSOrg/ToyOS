//! holding `INIT`'s value plus the two bits `smp.rs`'s trampoline ORs in to
//! reach long mode, so a CPU that skips this file runs with caching disabled and
//! `WP`, `NE` and `NXE` clear.
//!
//! All three are written whole, so every bit of each is decided here. `CR0`'s
//! value is a constant; four of `CR4`'s bits are the silicon's to offer, so its
//! value is *required plus whatever of the optional set this CPU has* — a
