//! The machine's clocks: monotonic since boot, and the wall clock anchored to
//! it once.
//!
//! The monotonic half calibrates the TSC against the HPET at boot and reads the
//! TSC afterwards. The wall-clock half reads the CMOS RTC **exactly once**, in
//! [`init_wall`], and answers every later question as that reading plus
//! [`nanos_since_boot`].
//!
//! Once and not per call: a CMOS read is a port-I/O handshake that can block on
//! the update flag for as long as a second, so a process asking the time in a
//! loop would drive one per iteration — and a per-caller read gives a machine
//! with two FAT volumes two answers to what time it is and no rule about which
//! wins.
//!
//! Once also means the answer can be *absent*: an RTC that never replies is a
//! boot with no wall clock, [`local_secs`] and [`utc_secs`] say so in their
//! return type, and every consumer decides what to do about it. Nothing here
//! invents 1970.
