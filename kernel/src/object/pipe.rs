//! A pipe's two ends, as two object types.
//!
//! "Write to a read end" is a state that cannot be written rather than a
//! runtime `PermissionDenied`: [`PipeReadEnd`] has no write path, and the typed
//! accessor refuses the handle before any policy runs.
//!
//! **The ring, its refcounts and its `PipeId` stay in `crate::pipe` until
//! chunk 6.** `SYS_PIPE_OPEN`, `SYS_PIPE_ID` and `SYS_SOCKET_CREATE` are live
//! until then and every one of them is addressed by that id, so a `PipeShared`
//! here would be a second owner of the same counts. What these two types own is
//! the *end* — one counted reference each — and giving it back on the last
//! handle is what makes EOF ride `handle_count`.
