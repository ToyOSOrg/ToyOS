//! One process's handle table.
//!
//! Lives inside `ProcessData`, behind the lock that is already there — no new
//! lock and no new ordering edge. Every accessor hands back an **owned** value:
//! no borrow into the table can outlive the guard, which is what stops a
//! syscall holding a reference into a table another thread of the same process
//! is editing.
//!
//! **This is not a file-descriptor table and the word does not appear here.**
//! A process holds typed handles; `fd` names the interface of exactly one layer,
//! `userland/libc`, and std's POSIX surface keeps it by charter. Anywhere else
//! in this tree — kernel, ABI, SDK, a test binary — the word is wrong (owner
//! ruling, 2026-08-19), and so is `io_uring`: that mechanism is an inbox.
//!
//! **A slot's generations are finite and what happens at the end of them is a
//! security decision, not an overflow.** A handle carries twelve bits of slot
//! and twenty of generation, so a slot has 1,048,575 lifecycles; a table that
//! wrapped would hand the holder of an ancient handle a live object again,
//! which is a use-after-free of authority however improbable. It does not wrap:
//! by owner ruling of 2026-08-20 a slot at its last generation **retires**, and
//! [`Slot`] is the shape that decision takes — a retired slot has no generation
//! to be issued at, so no insertion path can offer one by forgetting to look.
