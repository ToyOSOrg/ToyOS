/// that word passes the report's timestamp. An `fsync` that stopped at the page
/// cache would make the whole durability contract a claim about nothing. The

/// which needs a number, needs discussion, and would make every *other*
/// `fsync` in the machine quietly weaker than the one program that noticed.
///
/// **What guards it is `usb_flush_optional`**, whose whole subject is a device
/// that refuses SYNCHRONIZE CACHE: it reds the moment this call stops issuing
/// one. `kernel_log_file`'s mid-run read of the image is the positive half.
/// Neither separates *which* level a flush reached, so an `fsync` that went
/// back to stopping at the page cache would still pass a clean shutdown — the
/// refusing device is the only instrument that sees it.
///
/// # The retry loop: slow is not failed
///
/// **This is the operation level `crate::block`'s constants speak of, and the
/// one depth on the flush path that holds no spinlock** — everything below
/// `crate::vfs::lock()` runs with preemption off, four ticket locks deep at
/// the device wait (`issues/audio/disk-wait-pins-a-cpu.md`), so no layer
/// underneath can wait between attempts without pinning a CPU for the wait.
/// Here the guard is dropped, the CPU is yielded or parked, and the whole
/// sequence is retried with a fresh [`block::OPERATION`] per attempt: the
/// per-attempt bound stays the slowness detector and never grows, and the run
/// of attempts is what [`block::DEADMAN`] bounds.
///
/// A volume is declared failed on exactly three evidences — the device's own
/// error status (any refusal but `WouldBlock`, passed through unchanged), a
/// reset escalation that itself failed (the driver turns that into a device
/// fact: `dev.failed`, `usb-storage: … reset recovery failed`), or this
/// deadman expiring — and never on the elapsed time of a single attempt. A
/// timed-out attempt discarded nothing: `Vfs::flush_file` returns before
/// `clear_dirty` on any refused page and restores the file's `dirty_meta` when
/// it fails (`file_cache::take_dirty`/`mark_dirty_meta`), and the driver's
/// budget refusal is taken between commands with nothing in flight, so the
