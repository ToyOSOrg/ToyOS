//! A process, as something a handle can name.
//!
//! **The exit code belongs to the object, not to a table entry.** A pid-keyed
//! wait needed the process table to keep a corpse around until somebody claimed
//! it, which is what a zombie was, and it needed rules for who was allowed to
//! claim one and what happened when nobody did. None of that exists here: the
//! spawn that made the process answered with a handle, the teardown publishes
//! the code into the object that handle names, and the table entry is freed as
//! soon as its threads are gone. A wait after the fact reads a value; a wait
//! before it parks and is woken by the publish.
//!
//! So there is no reap, no orphan adoption, no "exactly once" and no window in
//! which an exit is missed — and a process nobody holds a handle to simply
//! disappears.
