//! Kernel objects, and the identity every one of them carries.
//!
//! Every object is a plain `Arc<T>`. There is no custom refcounting, no `Weak`
//! anywhere in the graph, and no `dyn` hierarchy: `Arc` already proves
//! drop-exactly-once-after-the-last-reference, and hand-rolled counting is the
//! bug class this layer exists to delete.
//!
//! **`handle_count` is not the Arc count, and that is load-bearing.** This
//! kernel does not unwind, so an `Arc` a syscall cloned out of a table before
//! blocking is stranded on the kernel stack of a thread another CPU killed. If
//! EOF and dead-peer detection rode Arc counts, killing an audio client blocked
//! in its signal-pipe read — the steady state of every cpal client — would
//! leak the read end and soundd would never learn. So every *userland-visible*
//! lifecycle event rides `handle_count`, which process teardown drains on the
//! killer's CPU. The stranded `Arc` leaks memory: bounded, visible in the
//! [`census`], and unable to delay a semantic event.
//!
//! **The count is drained on the killer's CPU; the event is not published
//! there.** What a peer sees is the `on_zero_handles` hook, and that runs from
//! [`ZERO_QUEUE`] on whichever CPU drains next — so a kill can return with the
//! victim's read end still held and the peer's next write accepted. Measured,
//! and the reason nothing may read "the count reached zero" as "the peer has
//! been told": `issues/kernel/deferred-release-outlives-its-syscall.md`.

// Every unsafe block under `object::` carries a `SAFETY:` comment —
// measured and documented in full by
// `issues/build/clippy-has-never-run-here.md`'s per-area plan.
// `host-tests.yml`'s kernel clippy step already runs with `-D warnings`, so
// `warn` here is what actually gates: a new undocumented block anywhere in
// this module tree fails CI, while the rest of the kernel (not yet swept)
// stays silent.
