//! A region of memory more than one process can see.
//!
//! A region is an object: holding a handle to one is the whole of being allowed
//! to map it, and giving one away is `SYS_HANDLE_SEND`.
//!
//! **Two lifetimes, and keeping them apart is the point.** The *mappings* go
//! when the last handle goes, from the deferred queue with nothing held,
//! because that is a userland-visible event and a handle a killed thread
//! stranded must not delay it. The *pages* go when the last `Arc` goes, which
//! is strictly later — a handle holds an `Arc` — so the unmap and its shootdown
//! are always in front of the free. A driver that keeps its own `Arc` past a
//! mode change is relying on exactly that: the compositor's mapping of the old
//! scanout stays valid until the compositor closes it, and nothing revokes.
