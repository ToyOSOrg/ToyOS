//! Kernel event tracing — per-CPU ring buffer of scheduler/timer/IRQ events.
//!
//! Designed to be dumped from LLDB on a wedged kernel. Writer is single-CPU (the
//! ring belongs to the current CPU) but must tolerate interrupt recursion, so
//! slot allocation uses `fetch_add` on the head index. Event payload writes are
//! non-atomic — a reader may observe a torn record for the most recent entry,
//! which is acceptable for a debug tool.
//!
//! Symbol `TRACE_RINGS` is the array of per-CPU rings. From LLDB:
//!   (lldb) p &TRACE_RINGS
//!   (lldb) memory read --size 8 --count 2 <head_addr>
//!
//! # Relationship to `toyos_sched::hw::TraceEvent`
//!
//! The kernel and the simulator share one event vocabulary in two
//! representations, and deliberately so:
//!
//! * `hw::TraceEvent` is the vocabulary — a closed Rust enum the simulator
//!   holds by value and asserts on. It has no layout guarantee, so it cannot
//!   be the thing on the wire.
//! * [`Record`] below is the wire form — `repr(C)`, 24 bytes, discriminants
//!   fixed by hand — because its reader is `memory read` in LLDB, which cannot
//!   parse a Rust enum.
//!
//! [`record`] is the total mapping from the first onto the second, and is what
//! [`crate::hw::KernelHw`] installs as `Machine::trace`. The ring also keeps
//! kinds the core cannot produce ([`Kind::IrqDrain`], [`Kind::TimerArm`],
//! [`Kind::Preempt`]) — kernel observations from below the boundary.
//!
//! **There is one reader, not two.** LLDB alone wants every property of the
//! wire form; this ring cannot feed a simulator replay, because a sim
//! `Scenario` is a *workload* — which queue each thread blocks on, what makes
//! its condition true, how long it runs — and the ring records none of that. It
//! records an observed schedule, from a buffer of [`RING_CAPACITY`] entries
//! that wraps, so a capture is a tail with no initial state to replay from. So
//! a numeric discriminant has one consumer, and the const assertions below are
//! what make "do not reorder" a build error rather than a comment.
