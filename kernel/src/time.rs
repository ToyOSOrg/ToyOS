//! Every duration in this kernel is one of a closed set of *kinds*, and the
//! constructor of each demands what justifies it.
//!
//! A bare `u64` of nanoseconds is not a thing: it says nothing about where
//! the number came from, and — the part that actually costs — it says
//! nothing about what happens when it runs out. Three of the four
//! behaviours a kernel duration can have at expiry are *different failures*
//! (a device that broke, a machine that broke, an answer that got smaller), and
//! a type that cannot tell them apart is a type that lets an implementer pick
//! the wrong one silently.
//!
//! | kind | what it is | where the number comes from | expiry means |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`Bound`] | the contract that says the thing will happen | a device register, or a cited spec section | the device broke — a named error, never a retry |
//! | [`Cadence`] | how often a thing may be re-done | what makes that rate affordable | nothing; it is a rate |
//! | [`Tripwire`] | a duration whose expiry is a **panic** | how long is absurd | the machine is broken; fail fast |
//! | [`Deadline`] | an absolute [`Instant`] a **caller** chose | userland, or a caller's own arithmetic | the caller's business |
//! | [`Floor`] | a bound on *another* duration | policy, stated between two bounds | nothing; nothing waits |
//! | [`Budget`] | a wall-clock allowance | what the answer costs when it is spent | a degraded answer, named |
//! | [`Delay`] | a duration the caller **spends** | a spec that mandates it, or what is being measured | nothing; the spending is the point |
//!
//! **Seven, where §3 wrote six, and the seventh is this sweep's own finding.**
//! §3.1 added `Floor` and §3.3 added `Budget` the same way: the sweep is what
//! makes the taxonomy total, and a duration that fits nothing is a finding
//! rather than a licence to invent a citation. [`Delay`] is what the six could
//! not hold — a mandatory hardware settle (`CODEC_DETECT`, D3hot recovery,
//! the SDM's INIT/SIPI delays) and a calibration window (`clock::init`,
//! `apic::init_timer`) are durations the CPU *spends*, not durations something
//! is waited for. Nothing expires; there is no error, no panic and no degraded
//! answer, because the elapsing **is** the success path. Classifying them as
//! `Bound`s would have made "expiry means the device broke" false of a third of
//! the `Bound`s in the tree.
//!
//! **RT7, and what it actually buys.** There is no `Bound::from_nanos`, no
//! `Tripwire::from_nanos` and no way to build any kind from a magnitude alone:
//! every constructor takes the justification as a `&'static str` beside the
//! number. A number nobody can cite is a [`Tripwire`] or it does not exist.
//!
//! **What a panic may be about, and it is the rule the two panicking kinds cost
//! the most to learn.** A panic asserts what its own site observes, and nothing
//! a workload scales. A latency, a rate of progress, a time-to-complete: each of
//! those is device time and workload time added together, so each is *measured*,
//! reported, and gated in the harness — where a number can be read and argued
//! with — and none of them is asserted here. Three successive scheduler designs
//! were lost to the other reading, and every one of them was locally plausible:
//! the constant looked generous, the composition that outgrew it was one level
//! down, and the kernel died naming its own bound instead of the workload that
//! had exceeded it. The question to ask of a number before it becomes a
//! [`Tripwire`] is whether it gets larger when the machine gets busier. If it
//! does, it is not one.
//!
//! **What is not a duration**, stated because the sweep had to decide it twice:
//! a spin *count* is not one — `serial.rs`'s `PANIC_LOCK_SPIN_LIMIT` and
//! `THRE_SPIN_LIMIT`, `sync.rs`'s 50M/500M — even where a doc comment prices it
//! in seconds. Neither is an *instant* stored in a static (`FIRST_IRQ_NS`,
//! `NEXT_REPORT_NS`, `LOG_DURABLE_NS`): those are [`Instant`]s the machine
//! remembers, and what a kind classifies is the *interval* somebody chose.
//!
//! This file names nothing outside `core`. That is a requirement rather than a
//! style: `kernel-loom` compiles it a second time so the completion core's
//! records can carry an [`Instant`] into a model, and a dependency on a subject
//! would stop that compiling. `clock::now` is the one bridge to the machine's
//! clock and it lives in `clock.rs`, not here.
