//! The lock a contender parks on.
//!
//! One sentence: **a CPU never spins on a lock whose holder is descheduled**
//! — a contender takes a ticket, arms on the lock's own watch and gives the
//! CPU back, and the release posts to the one whose turn it now is.
//!
//! **Preemption stays on for the holder, and that is the whole point.** A
//! [`crate::sync::Lock`] guard raises the preempt count for its whole life, so
//! its holder cannot be descheduled and a lock held across a device round trip
//! pins a CPU for the length of that trip: at the moment of a disk transfer
//! this kernel is four ticket spinlocks deep. A [`SleepGuard`] raises
//! nothing, so `scheduler::assert_baseline` keeps meaning exactly what it means
//! today: *a spinlock is held*.
//!
//! **Nothing in the kernel holds one yet.** The four statics that will hold one
//! (`vfs::VFS`, `fat32_adapter::VOLUMES`, `xhci::XHCI`, `process::ProcessData`)
//! convert together, because converting any one of them alone parks with the
//! other three still ticket locks and trips `assert_baseline` by construction.
//! So this module is `allow(dead_code)` until they do. What keeps it
//! honest meanwhile is not the kernel but `kernel-loom`, which compiles this
//! file a second time and drives the real acquire.
//!
//! **This file is compiled a second time by `kernel-loom`**, so it may name only
//! what that crate supplies — the layout rule `completion::inbox` carries
//! too. Seven items in two modules
//! (`completion::{Outcome, Subject, Token, Watch, wait_uncancellable_until}`,
//! `scheduler::{current_task, Parkable, TaskId}`), all of them either compiled
//! there already or three lines of arithmetic. A file that named a pipe end or
//! a device claim could not be modelled at all, and on x86 — where every load is
//! an acquire — a missing edge here is invisible to every guest test.
//!
//! ## Why a ticket and not a bit
//!
//! One word, CAS `FREE` → me, and a release that posts to *everyone* armed, is
//! shorter. It is also a thundering herd, and worse, it starves: a woken
//! contender that loses the race to a caller arriving fresh on another CPU goes
//! back to sleep with nothing owed to it, for ever. A ticket makes the wake
//! *addressed* — the contender arms with its own ticket as the completion token
//! and the release posts to that token alone, which is [`completion::post_n`]'s
//! existing shape and the reason it takes a token at all. One waiter wakes, it
//! is the one whose turn it is, and the order is the order they arrived in.
//!
//! ## What it costs, counted rather than asserted
//!
//! One read-modify-write per uncontended acquire and one per uncontended
//! release — the same two `Lock` pays — plus one plain store of the holder on
//! each side and one relaxed load of the watch's arm count on the release. That
//! surcharge is the whole of what [`SleepLock::holder`] and the addressed wake
//! cost a lock nobody is waiting on. The contended paths add four RMWs to the
//! acquirer and three to the releaser, all of them on the far side of a park.
//! Nothing on either path is a `fetch_add` on a *count*: one such increment
//! per log line cost 350 ms of boot under TCG.
//!
//! ## The two rules an acquirer has to know
//!
//! * **A `SleepLock` taken while a [`crate::sync::Lock`] is held must go through
//!   [`SleepLock::try_lock`]** — [`Parkable::at_entry`] asserts the context's
//!   baseline preempt depth, so the token a park needs cannot be made at that
//!   depth. That ordering is enforced rather than reviewed.
//!   The converse is free: a `Lock` may be taken while a `SleepGuard` is held.
//! * **A `SleepLock` may not be acquired from inside an armed wait's
//!   predicate.** `completion::arm` refuses a second arm on one inbox by name,
//!   and a contended acquire arms. So the `ready` closure a caller hands
//!   `completion::wait_until` may take a `try_lock` and may not take a `lock`.
//!   Nothing in the tree does either today; it is written down because the
//!   failure is a named panic at a call site that looks innocent.

// **Retired by the change that gives this type its first holder.** Every item
// below has a caller in `kernel-loom/tests/sleep_lock.rs` and none in the
// kernel, because a lock converted alone parks with the other three still
// ticket locks and trips `assert_baseline` by construction. Deleting
// the primitive and writing it again at the conversion would land it and its
// four callers in one commit.
