//! Loom: the idle loop's reap gate.
//!
//! The gate exists so that a CPU with nothing to run does not take
//! `PROCESS_TABLE` on every trip round the idle loop — the standing aggressor
//! against the crash report's `try_lock`, which is the whole reason a fault
//! report could print a bare address for a symbol that was right there.
//! Gating housekeeping on a flag is only sound if
//! the flag cannot lose a raise, and that is what these models are for: a raise
//! concurrent with a claim, from every interleaving loom can build.
//!
//! Two directions, and both matter:
//!
//! * **Nothing enrolled, nothing claimed** — the property the fix is for. A
//!   gate nobody raised answers `false`, so the idle loop takes no lock.
//! * **A raise is never dropped** — the property the fix must not cost. Work
//!   enrolled is work some trip claims, and the claimer sees it.
//!
//! On x86 every store is a release, so a build with the raise relaxed behaves
//! identically to this one and no guest test can fail here. The negative case is
//! a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel/loom/Cargo.toml --features reap-raise-relaxed \
//!   --test reap_gate
//! ```
//!
//! makes `reap_gate.rs`'s `raise` store relaxed and this file must red, at
//! [`a_claim_sees_the_enrolled_work`] — *a claimed gate handed the reaper an
//! unpublished exit*, which is the defect stated exactly.
