//! Loom: what publishing a shard's pointer publishes.
//!
//! **The pointer is not the payload.** An AP's shard is `alloc_zeroed` memory
//! whose `head` the BSP writes before the pointer is stored; a reader that saw
//! the pointer without that ordering would read whatever the heap held under a
//! slot's sequence number and accept it if it happened to equal the number it
//! asked for. On x86 every store is a release and this cannot happen. **ARM64
//! is planned.**
//!
//! The negative case is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel/loom/Cargo.toml --features shard-publish-relaxed \
//!   --test log_publish
//! ```
//!
//! makes both sides of the pointer's publication relaxed and this file must red
//! — loom answers `Causality violation: Concurrent load and mut accesses`,
//! which is the reader reaching the shard's own words while the publisher is
//! still building them. Verified 2026-08-17, both ways round.
