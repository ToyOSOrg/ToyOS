//! `Elf64_Rela` tables, as a view over bytes.
//!
//! A relocation is an instruction to write `width` bytes at a file-chosen
//! offset with a file-influenced value, so this is the trust boundary's
//! sharpest edge. [`RelocKind::write_width`] is the one table the validator and
//! the writers both read: a type missing from it is a type nobody patches, and
//! a type in it that no writer handles would be validated for a write that
//! never happens. Neither can drift, because there is one table.
