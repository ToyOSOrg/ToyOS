//! ELF64 decoding, for the questions ToyOS asks a program image: **what does
//! this file want mapped, where does everything it names live inside it, and
//! which of the numbers in it may the kernel act on?**
//!
//! An ELF is untrusted input — `spawn` opens whatever path a process names and
//! `dlopen` opens whatever path a process names — so the kernel's fail-fast
//! rule does not apply to anything decoded here. Every length, count, offset
//! and vaddr is checked before it is used, nothing is indexed without a bound,
//! and no path panics. What cannot be satisfied is refused by name through
//! [`Error`]; nothing is silently truncated to fit.
//!
//! `no_std`, no allocation, no `unsafe`. The bounded pieces are bounded by
//! constants in this crate ([`MAX_LOAD_SEGMENTS`], [`MAX_TLS_ALIGN`]); the
//! unbounded ones — a relocation table, a symbol table, a section header table
//! — are *views* over bytes the caller already holds, so nothing here is sized
//! by a number the file chose.
//!
//! # What this crate is not
//!
//! It maps nothing, allocates nothing and writes nothing. Turning a
//! [`Layout`] into an address space, applying a relocation and copying a TLS
//! template are the kernel's, and the split is the point: everything in here
//! is a pure function of bytes and is tested on the host in milliseconds.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! ELF64, little-endian, `ET_DYN`, `EM_X86_64` or `EM_AARCH64`. Everything else
//! is refused by name rather than tolerated: ToyOS emits PIE binaries only, has
//! no 32-bit mode and no big-endian target. A loader names the machine it runs
//! ([`Layout::parse`]), so an image for the other one is refused as
//! [`Error::WrongMachine`] before anything of it is mapped.
