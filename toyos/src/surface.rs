//! Key events down the surface tree.
//!
//! A **surface** is something with a screen and a keyboard: the compositor's
//! windows, `/system/bin/terminal`, `/system/bin/console`. Its owner reads key transitions
//! from whatever is above it and decides what they mean — which for a terminal
//! is bytes on its child's stdin, through a [`toyos_keymap::Translator`] it
//! owns alone.
//!
//! A child that wants the transitions themselves rather than the bytes asks
//! for them here. `locale detect` is the reason this exists: it identifies a
//! keyboard by which HID usage a *labelled* key reports, so the one thing it
//! must not be handed is the current layout's opinion of that key. The
//! keyboard device is claimed exclusively, and under a desktop or a console
//! the surface owner holds it, so before this the wizard refused to run at all
//! wherever anyone would actually run it.
//!
//! Two things travel this channel and nothing else:
//!
//! - **The grab.** A client asks for raw keys; the host answers granted or
//!   refused, and while a grab is held the surface's own translation stops.
//!   The answer is not optional — a client that assumed it had the keys would
//!   wait forever for events going somewhere else.
//! - **A layout change.** [`LAYOUT_CONFIG`] is the layout, and the message
//!   carries no name: it says only that the file changed, so no translator can
//!   hold an opinion that disagrees with it.
//!
//! **The channel is a port, not a name.** A surface makes its own — one per
//! terminal, one per console — and puts the connector in the namespace it
//! builds for the shell it spawns. A wizard three processes below a terminal
//! still finds it, because the namespace is inherited down the same chain the
//! environment used to be; nothing outside that chain can name it, and nothing
//! in it can name a service its parent did not pass.
