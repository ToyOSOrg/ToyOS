//! A port, and the two ends of it.
//!
//! Two types, so a client holding a [`Connector`] cannot accept the service's
//! connections: that is a state the compiler refuses rather than a
//! `PermissionDenied` at run time.
//!
//! **A port exists before either process runs.** Whoever creates it hands the
//! acceptor to the server and the connector to its clients, so a connection
//! works from a client's first instruction whether or not the server has
//! reached `accept` or has even been spawned. There is nothing to retry and no
//! timeout anywhere.
