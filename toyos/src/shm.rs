//! Shared memory with RAII.
//!
//! A region is a **handle**, not a token. Holding one is the whole of being
//! allowed to map it, so there is no grant and no list of pids to keep: giving
//! a peer access is [`SharedMemory::share`] plus
//! [`Connection::send_handles`](crate::ipc::Connection::send_handles), and a
//! peer that never receives it can never name it.
//!
//! The mapping goes away with the last handle, so dropping this is all the
//! cleanup there is.
