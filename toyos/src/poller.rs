/// **The kernel is the second writer of every byte below, so no Rust reference
/// covers any of it.** `inbox::post_completion` stores a whole [`Completion`]
/// and publishes the tail; `claim_submission` reads a submission slot and
/// advances the submission head. A `&T` carries `dereferenceable` into LLVM —
/// and for a `T` with no interior mutability `noalias` and `readonly` too — so
/// a `&RingHeader` here is a data race on `ring_size` whatever is then read
/// through it, and `&mut Submission`/`&Completion` (all integers, therefore
/// `Freeze`) are borrows the compiler is entitled to fold, hoist or split
/// against a kernel that is writing the same bytes.
///
/// So a ring header is reached one atomic word at a time (`AtomicU32::from_ptr`,
/// which is the only way to do an atomic operation on memory Rust does not own
/// and is *sound* over shared memory: an atomic's `UnsafeCell` is what withdraws
/// `noalias`/`readonly`), and an entry is one `ptr::write` or one
/// `read_volatile` of the whole struct — one access, not one the compiler may
/// split, fold or repeat.
///
/// This is the mirror of `kernel/src/inbox.rs`'s accessor block: the field
/// offsets come from `offset_of!` at both ends and `toyos_abi::inbox`'s
/// `RING_*_OFF` constants are what a reordering meets. `ring_size` has no
/// accessor at either end — both hold the sizes themselves rather than reading
