//! Asking `/system/bin/init` to start a declared program.
//!
//! **`SYS_SPAWN` can only give a child what the caller holds, and that is not
//! enough.** doom is started from a shell and doom is to hold sound; the shell
//! is not. Under inheritance alone doom could hold sound only if every shell
//! did. So init serves `launcher`: the caller names a `[programs]` key, init
//! looks up what the manifest says that program holds, builds it out of the
//! connectors and claims *init* holds, and spawns it.
//!
//! **The asker's authority is one connector**, and the policy is the manifest.
//! A launch adds nothing to what the caller could do itself: the stdio handles
//! and the extra connectors travel from the caller's own table, which is the
//! same bound `SYS_SPAWN` has. What it *adds* is that the child's namespace is
//! its own manifest row rather than a narrowing of its parent's.
//!
//! The wire is a single frame plus one handle batch, and this module is both
//! halves of it — std's `Command` encodes and `/system/bin/init` decodes.
