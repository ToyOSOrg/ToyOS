# Nothing explains why doom's audio callback stalled on the T14

doom's sound producer can no longer kill the game when its callback stops
consuming — `doom_sound_flood` stages exactly that and the game lives — and
that is the whole of what is now known. **Why the callback stopped on the
owner's machine, about five seconds into play, is not.** The evidence is one
abort message, because the process that would have carried the answer is the
one that died.

An audio client's RT standing is *lent*, not held: soundd claims the audio
device, takes the RT band with it (`main.rs:705`), and every pipe write it
makes lends the woken reader a one-quantum window (`wake_pipe_readers`).
**On a machine with no audio device none of that happens.** The null
sink deliberately does not request the band — it protects no audible output —
so `driver::current_is_rt()` is false at its `signal_clients` write and the
client's callback thread is woken as an ordinary thread. The T14 has no audio
device. So the one thing that keeps a 2.9 ms deadline met was absent there and
is present in every config the suite runs.

That is a mechanism, not a measurement, and two others are equally live: the
`drain_irqs` entry, `issues/kernel/scheduler-pass-blocks-in-xhci.md`,
where any syscall on that thread can become the USB
driver's engine for as long as a second; and plain scheduling pressure from a
game thread and a compositor that never yield to it.

**One runner sighting is filed under this name and is not this defect.** In run
`31247206462`, `doom_sound_flood` was `timed out after 88s` when re-run alone,
against 4–26 s on the dev host, and 0 of 5 in the rate probe five days later —
a sighting without a rate, carried as a row in `src/redlist.rs`. It was one of
four reds in that run, three of them soundd's, which is why they were read
together at the time; of the other three, `metal_sim_null_audio` was a test
reading a boot line through a span of host wall clock and is closed,
`hda_client_stall` was a `DEADLOCK` between the idle loop's log-file flush and
the xHCI disk lock and is no longer reachable, and `sshd_fail_closed` is
undiagnosed and has its own row. Nothing in that run's capture names the
callback, so it neither supports the mechanism above nor rules it out.

What would decide it is the callback's own period count against wall clock, on
that machine. doom now keeps that counter (`MIXED_PERIODS`) and now survives
the stall, so the next T14 session can be asked the question instead of losing
the process that would have answered it.
