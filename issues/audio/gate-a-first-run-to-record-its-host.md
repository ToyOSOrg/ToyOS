# The first gate A run to record its host: four of six boots outside the recorded sample, two of them harm

2026-08-07, tree `4a0a07f`, the run that verified the host-conditions
annotation itself (`cargo test -- audio_tone`, filtered). Every line below is
the harness's own, printed beside the counters it qualifies:

```
audio_tone      smp=1  gaps 1 [3p]  underruns 3/1137  drains 8  wake_lat 86862us (3.74 pl)  host: load 49.8/22.7/15.0 qemu 1 toyos-build 4
        confirm        gaps none    underruns 0/1136  drains 0  wake_lat 16968us (0.73 pl)  host: load 49.0/23.4/15.4 qemu 1 toyos-build 4
audio_tone      smp=8  gaps 1 [1p]  underruns 1/1113  drains 0  wake_lat 28118us (1.21 pl)  host: load 48.3/24.1/15.7 qemu 1 toyos-build 4
        confirm        gaps none    underruns 0/1111  drains 0  wake_lat  8434us (0.36 pl)  host: load 46.5/24.1/15.8 qemu 1 toyos-build 3
audio_tone_load smp=1  gaps none    underruns 0/1132  drains 0  wake_lat  7174us (0.31 pl)  host: load 41.2/23.7/15.7 qemu 1 toyos-build 3
audio_tone_load smp=8  gaps none    underruns 0/1126  drains 0  wake_lat 23083us (0.99 pl)  host: load 37.9/23.6/15.8 qemu 1 toyos-build 3
```

**The invocation passed**, and correctly: harm appeared on both `audio_tone`
configs and neither reproduced on its confirming boot, which is precisely what
the two-boot rule is for. What it passed *with* is the finding.

- `audio_tone.smp1` at **86862us — 3.74 pipeline depths, 8.6x that config's
  recorded worst (10090us), and past its 56000us ceiling.** The baseline file
  records `ceiling_runs = 0` across all 120 runs of the 2026-07-31 sample; this
  is the first breach since. It came with `drains 8` — the ceiling exactly —
  three periods of silence on the wire and a 3-period gap in the capture.
- **Two of six boots passed a whole pipeline depth** (3.74 and 1.21), which the
  baseline file states no run of its 120 reached.
- `audio_tone_load.smp8` at 23083us is 2.9x its recorded worst with no harm at
  all — the "bad but real" shape the ceilings exist to admit.

**And now the conditions are on the record rather than reconstructed.** 1-minute
load 37.9-49.8 on 14 cores with three to four other `toyos-build` processes and
no other guest, against the 4.2-6.1 the 2026-07-29 ceiling derivation recorded
per run — six to twelve times it. Under the owner's ruling of 2026-08-04 that is
**not** an excuse and not grounds to re-run it away: it is a defect of the
pipeline until something shows otherwise, and it is the same shape as the
load-stall family `issues/audio/thorough-tier-reds-on-unmodified-main.md`
records, its fast-tier and 142 ms sightings included. What is new is only that
the next investigation starts from a measured host state instead of a guess.

Whoever takes it: the thorough tier is the instrument for the rate, and it now
prints `host conditions over N runs` so its own arm's conditions can be stated.
The recorded arm's cannot — see `tests/audio-baseline.toml`.

## Promoted 2026-08-25

A measured ceiling breach (86862us, 8.6x the recorded worst, past the 56000us
ceiling, with three periods of silence behind it) on a passing invocation is
harm under the audio law. Owed to whoever runs gate A's thorough tier next:
read the `host conditions over N runs` line and decide whether the ceilings
need a host-load term.
