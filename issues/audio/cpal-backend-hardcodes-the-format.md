# The cpal ToyOS backend hardcodes 44100/2ch/i16 and rejects everything else

soundd's resampler and channel-conversion paths are unreachable from any real
client and therefore effectively untested. The backend also `assert_eq!`s the
device rate against a compile-time constant, so changing the driver's rate
aborts every cpal app.

Deferred to the quiet-tree window, not neglected: editing that fork needs
`.cargo/config.toml` path overrides, which redirect cpal for **every** agent in
the tree. Same scheduling constraint as the fork lint audit.

**Client liveness is blocked on this, not on soundd.** The ambiguity between a
paused and a wedged client is designed in: pausing is the client's stream
thread simply not reading its signal pipe, with no coordination of any kind,
and the cpal backend's `pause()` is a purely local futex store soundd is never
told about. No change confined to soundd can separate the two, and landing the
soundd and SDK halves alone would kill every paused cpal client. The
**protocol**, not the implementation, is what needs to change;
`issues/audio/a-client-cannot-tell-soundd-it-paused.md` is that change.

The assignment was reclaimed 2026-08-23: nobody holds it, and the block above is
what it is waiting on.
