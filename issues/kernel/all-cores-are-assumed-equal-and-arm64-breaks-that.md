# All cores are assumed equal, and ARM64 breaks that

Queued track from the 2026-08-16 owner conversation on scheduler direction.

Heterogeneous cores are the norm outside our current hardware: Intel P/E cores
(12th gen onward; the T14 Gen 2 predates the split) and ARM big.LITTLE, which is
universal on the ARM64 machines in scope
(`issues/kernel/arm64-is-a-decision-nobody-has-made.md`). A scheduler that
assumes equal cores places background churn on a fast core and a
latency-sensitive wake on a slow one, and its load arithmetic is wrong
everywhere.

What the track needs when picked up: a per-core capacity model; placement by
task character (bursty/latency-sensitive work on big cores, throughput work on
efficient ones); and eventually an energy model deciding when saving power beats
finishing sooner (the EAS school on ARM).

What is already done so this does not have to be retrofitted: reservation
admission sums against **each CPU's own capacity** — a reservation is a fraction
of a specific CPU, and "all cores equal" is never baked into the arithmetic.
That one decision is the cheap half; this issue is the expensive half, and it
waits for ARM64.
