# The scheduler and the clocks never talk

Queued track from the 2026-08-16 owner conversation on scheduler direction; the
furthest out of the set.

Two couplings every production scheduler has and ours lacks:

- **Frequency (DVFS)**: the scheduler knows every core's utilization and nobody
  else does, so it should feed whoever sets clock speeds (the schedutil
  arrangement) — including the race-to-idle question of whether finishing fast
  and sleeping beats pacing slow.
- **Idle-state awareness**: a deeply sleeping core takes real microseconds to
  wake. A latency-sensitive wake should prefer a shallow-idle core; a
  throughput task can pay to wake a deep one.

Both wait for the ACPI/power track (task #136 — own AML interpreter, battery
first) because today the kernel neither reads nor sets P-states or C-states on
metal. Filed so the placement track (see
`placement-is-blind-to-caches-and-topology.md`) leaves room for an idle-state
input when it designs wake placement.
