# A scheduler pass may spend two seconds in xHCI before it drains its mailbox

`sched::driver::pass` and `pass_block` both open with `drain_irqs()`, and
`drain_irqs` calls `xhci::poll_if_pending()` — **before** `with_cpu(...)`, and
therefore before the CPU's mailbox drain, its deadline fires and its pick. That
call is not bookkeeping. Its own doc-comment says so:

> it enumerates hot-plugged devices and recovers broken endpoints, and both spin
> on deadlines measured in seconds while holding `XHCI`, which is a ticket
> spinlock and therefore preemption off for its whole life.

The deadline is `xhci::USB_TIMEOUT_NS` = 2 s. `cpu::MAX_PASS_NS`, the budget the
scheduler core measures a pass against in `feature = "check"` builds, is 200 µs.
The two numbers disagree by four orders of magnitude, and the driver's prologue
sits on the wrong side of the boundary the budget describes.

What a CPU inside that recovery holds is *every message addressed to it*: an
`Adopt` carrying a task, a `Wake` for a parked thread, a `Retire`. Nothing in the
scheduler can shorten it — every reap and every wake is bounded by the owning
CPU's pass latency by design, which is exactly why the design is sound. The one
thing in the tree that notices is `scheduler::retire_task`'s 1 s guard, and it
notices by panicking:

```
retire_task: task not released after 1s: InTransit(CpuId(1))
```

That panic fired on the owner's T14 at 949.792 s of uptime with doom exiting. The
*balance*-path half of it is fixed: `hand_off` reaps a killed task rather than
handing it on, gated by simulator invariant I14. This half is not,
and it would produce the same panic with `Blocked(CpuId(n))` in the message
instead — the guard cannot tell a lost message from a busy CPU, which is what it
is written as if it could.

The second instance of the same shape used to be the idle loop's log flush;
the idle loop touches no filesystem now — the log is logd's file — and the
disk wait that survives, logd's `fsync` pinning a CPU for the device round
trip, is `issues/audio/disk-wait-pins-a-cpu.md`'s subject.

Closing this means making xHCI enumeration and endpoint recovery asynchronous, so
that `drain_irqs` only ever does work it can finish: drain the event ring,
dispatch HID reports, note that a port or an endpoint owes work. The debounce and
the port reset were already moved off this path for exactly this reason (CLAUDE.md,
USB hotplug); the control transfers inside `configure` and `recover_endpoints`
were not. Until then, `retire_task`'s bound is measuring the USB bus.

**And the budget cannot see it.** `cpu::MAX_PASS_NS` is measured against by
`SchedPass::finish`, from the `now` the pass was entered with to the end of
`finish_inner()` — and `drain_irqs()` runs *before* `SchedPass::begin`. The
prologue is outside the window the budget covers, so the pass-cost histogram
records a microsecond pass while the CPU had been in the driver for two seconds.
**The measured window has to start where the scheduler entry starts, and that
half of this issue is still open.**

The other half — that the gate ran nowhere — is closed. `sched_check_build`
(`tests/toyos.rs`) boots the `sched-check` kernel and `tests/common/passcost.rs`
judges what it publishes; the second sentence of the paragraph this replaced,
that invariant P "has never executed against the kernel in any image or any test
run", was true when it was written and has not been since. Invariant P itself no
longer exists: a pass's elapsed time is wall clock and a guest's wall clock
advances while a hypervisor holds its vCPU, so the budget is measured and gated
in the harness rather than asserted in the kernel (`tests/common/passcost.rs`).
Widening the window is untouched by that and is what this file still wants.
