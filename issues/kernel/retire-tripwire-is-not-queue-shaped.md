# `retire_task`'s tripwire is a constant against a term the workload sets

**This waits on a track, not on a decision:** the shape that closes it is
`issues/kernel/cpu-time-is-a-band-and-not-a-reservation.md`'s dying-server
chunk (`:32`, with the kill path's report and its one fixed-hop tripwire at
`:51`), so no audit should list this as ready to work.

`kernel/src/scheduler.rs`'s `GIVE_UP` is a `Tripwire` — a constant whose expiry
is a kernel panic. Its own derivation carries a term that is not constant:

> Times `1 + peers`, because one CPU runs one unwind at a time and this victim
> waits out the corpses queued ahead of it. Priced at `peers = 8`.

`peers` is the number of *other* killed tasks in `CpuSched::dying` on the
victim's CPU. Nothing bounds it, and every corpse past the priced eight adds
another `(1 + peers)`-th of the unwind term — 110 ms each on a saturated
real-time band, 10 ms on an idle one. The panic is reachable from a workload
that broke no rule.

**Two things this file previously said about that term are wrong, and both are
corrected here rather than left for the next reader to re-derive.**

*The trigger.* The shape named was "one process's threads torn down together
onto one CPU", and this kernel cannot produce it. `kill_process` and the exit
path both loop over a process's tids calling `scheduler::retire_task`, which
blocks until the victim has been released — so one process teardown holds at
most one corpse at a time on any CPU, however many threads the process has. The
producer of `peers > 0` is *concurrent independent retirers*: separate killer
threads retiring separate victims that happen to share a CPU. That is unbounded
in exactly the way the term needs, so the defect stands; only its stated cause
was wrong, and none of the remedies below is aimed differently because of it,
since all three bound the depth rather than the producer.

*The crossing point.* With fixed terms of 8.02 s and 110 ms per additional
corpse, the sum is 8.02 + 0.110 × N seconds: it equals the derivation's own
priced 9.01 s at N = 9, and first reaches the 10 s constant at N = 18. Nine is
the number of *further* corpses the 990 ms margin buys, not the total count at
which the constant is crossed — the two readings were conflated, understating
the crossing point by roughly a factor of two, and the earlier text stated both
readings in adjacent sentences.

The simulator states the same term honestly, because it can: `invariants.rs`'s
`retire_latency_bound` takes `peers` as a parameter and reads it off the run, the
way invariant I5's bound takes the runnable thread count. A wall clock in the
kernel has nothing to read it off.

**This predates bounded deferral and is not caused by it.** The
`(1 + peers) × UNWIND_NS` term entered the sim's I14 in the completion work's
first wave and the kernel-side derivation never priced `peers` at all until the
second. Aging multiplies the term by 11 under a saturated RT band, which makes
the crossing
point closer but does not create it.

Three shapes have been considered and none is this chunk's to choose:

1. **Bound the dying list.** A CPU that already holds *k* corpses refuses the
   *k+1*-th and the retire places it elsewhere. `hand_off` currently refuses to
   migrate a killed task for invariant 7's promptness reason, so this is a
   change to invariant 7 and not to a constant.
2. **Make the wait queue-shaped.** `retire_task` reads the victim CPU's
   `dying_len()` at arm time and scales its own deadline. That turns a
   `Tripwire` into something `kernel/src/time.rs` has no kind for — the type
   deliberately forbids a magnitude with a derivation attached.
3. **Stop waiting.** The wait exists because process teardown frees memory the
   dead thread's page tables still map. Revisiting that belongs to the
   completion architecture, which kills every wait.

**Remedy 2 was chosen, then withdrawn, and what replaced it was withdrawn
too.** The 2026-08-16 five-lens review of the reservation design
proved the arm-time depth read is the same defect again: the snapshot is taken
before the victim reaches the queue, so k concurrent retirers all read a depth of
zero and the k-th victim legally outlives a deadline whose expiry was a panic —
and the read itself is one scheduler-core invariant 2 forbids. The revision put
two assertions on the victim's CPU in its place; the 2026-08-17 second pass
proved both reachable from legal userland (a corpse parked in a 2 s transfer
against a queue-occupancy condition, and a 32 MiB dirty file against a progress
cadence), and the design now asserts **nothing** at the victim's end. What the
wait rests on instead is the dying server's admitted reservation — one entity,
one invariant, no term any workload scales — plus a report when a corpse's tenure
exceeds a derived expectation, which is loud and never fatal. None of the three
remedies above is the shape that landed. **This file closes when that change
lands, for the strongest reason available: the constant is deleted and nothing
was put in its place.**

Until then the constant is honest about what it does not cover, which is the
whole of what this file records.
