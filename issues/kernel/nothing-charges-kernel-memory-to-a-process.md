# Nothing charges a kernel allocation to the process that caused it

No allocation the kernel makes on a process's behalf is attributed to it, so
there is no per-process memory in `ps`, no `meminfo`, no reap-time assertion
that a dead process's charges went to zero, and no way for the suite to assert
the absence of a leak.

**The security case that once justified this is mostly gone, and that is the
news.** It was staged as an ownership discipline — a purpose-carrying allocator
type, aliases per subsystem, a charge on the four physical-memory chokepoints —
against a table of bugs that a different mechanism has since closed. Handle and
object lifetimes are refcount-driven with real `Drop` impls, so "a handle that
is not a value with a destructor" is unrepresentable; the descriptor type and
its un-refcounted clone are gone; the file cache installs a real budget and a
budget that was never installed is now a loud kernel bug; and the unbounded
user-string copy has a ceiling. What survives is the *accounting*, which nothing
has touched, plus one item: peak memory is written by two paths that overwrite
each other.

Accounting is a pillar of `issues/diagnostics/toyos-explains-itself.md`:
a process's counts and the machine's per-category counters are two sums of
the same charges.

Blocked on nothing. Two things worth knowing before it is restarted, because
both cost a day to discover:

- **Omitting `#[global_allocator]` enforces nothing** — rustc errors whenever
  `alloc` is in the graph at all. The enforcement is a type alias with no
  default parameter, about 50 lines, not the Rust-for-Linux approach of dropping
  `alloc` entirely.
- **`#[must_use]` is inadequate for an obligation like this**: binding, `let _
  =`, `drop()` and burial in a collection all pass silently. A drop bomb is the
  state of the art, and `Unmapped<T>` is already exactly such an obligation.

**The terminal state of every unbounded grower is a halted machine.** A failed
kernel allocation panics with the size, the layer and the call site named, and
every kernel panic halts, so a grower userland can drive is refused at its bound
or it ends the machine.
