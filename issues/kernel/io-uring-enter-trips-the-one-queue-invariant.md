# `io_uring_enter` trips "a task waits on at most one queue" in logd

On a KVM shard, in the boot `usb_boot_stick_pulled` stages, the kernel panicked
in logd's syscall:

```
[kernel 8.982 cpu2] PANIC: panicked at /__w/toyos/toyos/toyos-sched/src/waitq.rs:124:9:
a task waits on at most one queue

```

**The stimulus is the device going away, not input.** The boot stick was pulled
at 4.297 s — `usb-storage: reset recovery failed; disk is offline`, then
`usb-storage: write of 1 blocks at 17409 failed on disk 0` — and logd had
already said
`/log has not answered (the sync: other error) - this boot's log is on the
console only from /log/2026-08-15-181448_0010.log`. The panic is 4.7 s after
that, in logd's next `Poller::submit`.

**The stimulus is not the site.** The same assertion was recorded twice more
from a keyboard flood into a thread blocked in `sys_read` on stdin, reaching it
through `scheduler::wait_until::<kernel::keyboard::has_data>`: `Profile::MetalUsb`
under a few thousand injected key events a second, once with the i8042 present
and once with `q35,i8042=off`, so both the PS/2 and the USB delivery paths reach
it, and the victim both times was the in-guest runner blocked on stdin at
`===READY===`. It does not reproduce at ordinary typing rates. Two ways in, one
subject: a `waiting` flag left set by a previous wait of that thread, over
`set_waiting()` in `toyos-sched/src/task.rs`.

What the assertion says happened: this thread's task word still carried
*waiting* when `enter` prepared a new wait. `enter`'s loop consumes its ticket
on every exit it can see — `cancel()` on the error path, `cancel()` on the
satisfied re-check, `block_on` otherwise — so what is unaccounted for is a
previous wait of this thread that ended without clearing, and the pulled device
is what makes the ring's completions abnormal. Which wait that was is not
established here and a capture of one panic cannot establish it.

**The machine did not stop**, which is why this is a red and not a wedge: the
capture continues past the report to `pull-probe-91` at 13.795 s, with the
stick's re-insertion enumerating at 9.202 s in between. `usb_boot_stick_pulled`
refuses any post-pull capture carrying `PANIC:`, so the test names it.

Evidence, once: nightly dispatch `31900050723`, job `95049280131`
(`guest (3)`), `wt/toyos-ciwall`, 2026-08-15, in the serial phase.
`ALONE usb_boot_stick_pulled: GREEN, and it was alone both times — nothing the
harness controls differed, so it failed once and passed once. That is a rate
and not a classification.` The sibling dispatch `31900045901` (`main` at
`e064a96`) minutes earlier was green on this name, and the two trees differ
only in `src/testargs.rs`, `tests/toyos.rs` and one deleted issue file — the
kernel is the same kernel in the green run and the red one. A KVM shard runs
one guest per machine at `--jobs 1`, so host contention is not available as an
explanation either.

## 2026-08-16: the capture's path no longer exists, and the invariant is narrower

The completion work's one-park-site change took every blocking site off the
shared queues. `io_uring::enter` no longer registers on the ring's queue — it
arms on the ring as a *completion subject* and parks on the calling thread's
own `TaskHandle::park_queue`, one waiter per queue, machine-wide. The
`Ticket::register ← io_uring::enter` frame in the capture above is gone with
`enter`'s ticket, and so is the shape the assertion is about: with one queue
per task, "a task waits on at most one queue" can no longer be violated by two
*different* queues holding one task's node.

**The entry stays open, because that is not the same as the root cause.** What
the assertion actually reports is a `waiting` flag left set by a previous wait
of that thread, and the capture does not establish which wait that was. With
one park site the search is much smaller — the only queue a task can be on is
its own, and
every exit from `completion::wait` either commits (and `pass_block` finishes
the registration) or cancels (which dequeues) — but "smaller" is not "proved
absent", and no reproduction has been run against the new shape. Whoever sees
it again should re-read this: the backtrace will not look like the one above.

## One way in, found and closed

`WaitQueue::wake_one`/`wake_all` popped a waiter and cleared its flag as two
steps, so a waiter withdrawing in between found `dequeue` empty and its own
flag still set; `toyos-sched/loom/tests/loom_ticket.rs`'s
`cancel_and_wake_agree_on_who_won` reds on that schedule. Both clear under the
list lock now. It is a hole in the primitive rather than the capture above's
path — `scheduler::wake_sched` claims through `wake_direct`, and no kernel
caller of either reaches the list at all — so the entry stays open on every
path that has not been ruled out.

**Exit condition.** Reproducing the keyboard route deliberately, which means a
guest-side key generator rather than a host-side flood, and then accounting for
whichever wait left the flag set.
