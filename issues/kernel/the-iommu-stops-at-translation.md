# The IOMMU translates, and does none of what it exists for

Discovery and translation are built: every unit the machine reports is
inventoried, every function `pci::enumerate` returned gets a context entry
naming one identity-mapped domain, the fault event is armed, translation is on.
A unit this kernel cannot program is left switched off with a line naming the
register that decided it, which leaves that machine exactly as it boots with no
unit at all. Three gates stand on it, two of which strand a function above and
below its context entry — the only things in the suite that can tell a
translating unit from one that is merely switched on, because under identity
mapping every device *in* the tables behaves the same either way.

Interrupt remapping is built: every source is in the remappable format, `IRE` is
set, `CFI` is never written, and every table entry is source-id-verified against
the requester id its one source really carries. Per-driver domains and the
refusal are not. They land in this order and each leaves the tree green.

Of the two things this stage was told to verify rather than assume, one was
decided and one cannot be. QEMU does **not** block a compatibility-format
message once `CFI` is clear, though the specification requires it — measured, by
leaving one source at a time in that format and watching its device go on
working — so a source nobody moved keeps working here and black-screens on real
hardware. Whether the unit's own fault-event MSI is exempt is settled
by nothing in reach, the green fault gates included: QEMU sends that event
straight to the APIC without consulting the remapping path at all, so those
gates are consistent with the exemption holding and with the model blocking
nothing. Both, with the interrupt-cache invalidation that is unmeasurable for a
third reason, are recorded in
`issues/kernel/qemu-passes-compatibility-format-interrupts.md` as T14 questions.

**Domains, mapping, invalidation, faults.** Create/attach/map/unmap/flush, an
IOVA allocator, and the half of the fault handler that kills a process instead
of halting the machine: Bus Master Enable cleared on the offending function
(which is what lets the handler stay bounded once it no longer stops the
machine), a first-fault latch, a counter, a per-domain flag, the reschedule
handoff, and a storm ceiling. The portable seam grows here too — with one domain
and one backend, a domain id, a permission set, an error type and an `Iommu`
trait would each have a single value or a single implementor, which is why none
of them is in the tree. What is not negotiable is that teardown's slow half
never runs from the deferred zero-handle queue.

**The refusal.** Sequenced last, after the first userspace driver has moved
(`issues/kernel/every-driver-is-still-in-the-kernel.md`), because before that it
costs every machine with no vIOMMU — the default for QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware,
Parallels and essentially every cloud instance — and protects nothing that has
moved. Two rules need restating before they can be written, because as worded
they would refuse the harness's own machines: the extended-interrupt-mode rule
has to be stated in terms of the x2APIC ids actually in use rather than of
x2APIC being enabled — which is what interrupt remapping already does, since
QEMU reports `ECAP.EIM` clear and a table entry's destination is then eight
bits wide — and the isolation-scope rule refuses a device whose scope
is not a singleton — written for peer-to-peer behind a switch, and wrong for a
root-complex-integrated function, which is what both the audio and networking
targets on the T14 are. Restating it is the owner's call.

Risks that are not stage-specific:

- **Whether the harness's virtio devices are behind the unit is unknown.** QEMU
  bypasses the unit for a virtio device unless it is created with
  `iommu_platform=on`, which requires the guest to negotiate
  `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM` — these drivers do not. Under identity mapping the
  two are indistinguishable, so both isolation gates today run on ordinary
  emulated PCI functions. A host flag the guest silently declines is a vacuous
  gate: assert the negotiation guest-side.
- **Isolation scopes and reserved regions are modelled, not measured.** QEMU's
  topology is flat and publishes no RMRR; the T14 gives the first real answer,
  and it may refuse a device this project wants in userspace.
- **Cost is unmeasurable in the harness.** The 2× bar is answerable only on
  hardware, in a same-session A/B. So are cache-snooping walks, real
  access-control enforcement, and mid-DMA function reset on a real device.
