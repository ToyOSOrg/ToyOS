# The sites that still carry a boundary-crossing number in a plain integer

`toyos-untrusted`'s `Untrusted<T>` exists and the virtqueue used ring uses it:
`Virtqueue::used_ring_id` and `::used_ring_len` (`kernel/src/drivers/virtio.rs`)
are the only reads of a used ring in the kernel and hand back `Untrusted<u32>`,
so `Virtqueue::parse_used` is the only path to an index or a length and it names
its bound at both. The type has no arithmetic, no `Deref`, no `From`, no cast
and no accessor; the four `compile_fail` doctests on `Untrusted` are what that
sentence means, and `src/sourcegate.rs` bans the one shape typing cannot stop
(`at_most(u64::MAX)` and its four siblings).

**The rest of the class has not adopted it.** Until a site does, its bound is a
thing an author has to remember rather than a thing the compiler asks for. Each
of these is mechanical — find the read, wrap it there, name the bound at the use
— and none needs a design decision. **Each is cited by file and enclosing
symbol**, so whoever takes this does not have to re-derive which value is meant.

## The sites, hardest consequence first

- **`kernel/src/arch/syscall.rs`, the dispatch itself — partly done.**
  `SYS_SET_THREAD_NAME`'s `a2` was the named pattern: it `min`'d against
  `THREAD_NAME_LEN` and silently set the truncated prefix of a name too long
  to fit, the one clamp in the file where the rest already refuses. Converted:
  `a2` is now `Untrusted::new(a2).at_most(THREAD_NAME_LEN)`, refused with
  `InvalidArgument` rather than truncated. Behaviour change, gated by
  `tests/toyos-rust-tests/src/bin/abuse_thread_name.rs`
  (`test_rs_abuse_thread_name`), which reads the name back through
  `SYS_SYSINFO` and checks a refused call left it exactly as it was rather
  than silently truncated — not through `toyos_abi::syscall::set_thread_name`'s
  own return value, which it has always thrown away and which this pass left
  alone: touching `toyos-abi/src` claims the shared sysroot
  (`src/CLAUDE.md`'s buildlock section — "a doc-comment change... costs a
  sysroot claim exactly like a layout change"), and CLAUDE.md's own rule is
  that an ABI change lands on its own PR first. `set_thread_name`'s doc
  comment ("up to 28 bytes, truncated") is now stale and is that PR's to fix;
  nothing in the tree calls it today.
  **Still open**: the file's other ~31 `as usize` casts. The ones that size an
  allocation before a copy — `SYS_SPAWN`'s `endow_count`, `labels_len` and
  `slot_map_count`, `SYS_NAMESPACE_BUILD`'s `keep_n`/`add_n`/`names_len`,
  `SYS_HANDLE_SEND`/`SYS_HANDLE_RECV`'s count — are already named refusals
  against `MAX_ENDOWMENTS`/`MAX_LABELS_LEN`/`MAX_NAMESPACE_ENTRIES`/
  `MAX_TRANSFER_HANDLES` (`env_len` against `MAX_USER_STR` likewise, and is
  gated by `abuse_spawn_argv.rs`), so converting them is consistency rather
  than a behaviour fix — mechanical, per the original note, but left here
  because most have no dedicated over-bound test today and this pass did not
  want to touch the syscall dispatch's other paths without one.

- **`kernel/src/drivers/xhci/mod.rs`, the event ring — done, with one
  exception.** `Layout::device`'s hand-rolled `(slot_id as usize).checked_sub(1)?`
  is now `Untrusted::new(slot_id).map(|v| v.wrapping_sub(1)).index(self.dev_blocks)`
  — `wrapping_sub` is sound here only because `index` is the exit (slot 0 wraps
  to `u8::MAX`, never `< dev_blocks`, so it is refused by the same comparison
  as every slot past the pool). Behaviour-preserving: same `None` for the same
  inputs, and `xhci_many_devices` (`log.matches("beyond the pool")`) already
  gates the refusal path.
  **The `0x1F` scratchpad masking near `Layout::new` resisted the type.** It
  extracts two 5-bit HCSPARAMS2 fields — a fixed-width hardware bitfield, not a
  value with an independently-known bound to compare against. The "bound" and
  the mask are the same operation, so the only available exit would be
  `.at_most(0x1F)` immediately after a `.map()` that had already produced a
  value `<= 0x1F` by construction: a check whose `Err` arm is unreachable by
  construction, which is worse than the plain mask it would replace. Left as a
  mask, as `& 0x1F` extracting a spec-defined bit field is throughout this
  driver and the rest of the tree.

- **`kernel/src/drivers/nvme.rs`, the completion queue — converted.**
  `wait_completion` now takes the `cid` this driver put in the command
  (`(cmd.cdw0 >> 16) as u16`, read back out of the command it just submitted,
  not trusted again) and answers `Result<u16, Refused>`:
  `Untrusted::new(cq.cid).exactly(expected)`. `submit_and_wait` and all four
  callers (`admin`, `identify_namespace` through it, `read_sectors`,
  `write_sectors`) now match on the result and log-and-fail exactly as they
  already did for a bad status word. `Untrusted::exactly`'s own behaviour is
  covered by `toyos-untrusted`'s host test suite
  (`exactly_refuses_by_naming_both_numbers`).
  **No dedicated boot-level gate** — unlike the virtqueue used ring, this
  queue has no actuator today, and building one (`#[cfg(feature =
  "boot-actuators")]` writer + self-test + `actuator.rs` entry +
  `MACHINE_TESTS` registration) means a `tests/test-durations` entry, which
  this session watched block PR #118's own merge on exactly that mechanism
  (`ci/durations`: "committed UNMEASURED profile marker(s) are provisional and
  may not land"). Given the issue's own framing — "sound today only because
  every submission is synchronous, a property of the caller" — this is
  hardening against a future asynchronous queue rather than a live defect, so
  the landing risk was judged not worth it this pass. An
  actuator + self-test mirroring `drivers/virtio.rs`'s `used_selftest` is the
  future work if the owner wants it exercised on every boot.

- **`kernel/src/drivers/acpi.rs` — already fixed, not by this type.** The two
  underflowing subtractions F5 named are gone: `Table::open` (added since the
  assessment) validates a table's declared length against its floor and a
  `MAX_TABLE_LEN` ceiling and its checksum before anything reads out of it, so
  `xsdt.len - size_of::<SdtHeader>()` and `madt.len - size_of::<Madt>()` are
  now total by construction — the module doc says so in the past tense
  ("This is the second underflow that was here"). `TableError` is already a
  named `Result` refusal, exactly what `Untrusted` would add. Applying
  `Untrusted` on top would be ceremony over an already-safe abstraction, so
  nothing changed here. No longer belongs on this list.

- **`bcachefs/src/btree.rs`'s `collect_all`.** Closed: it was not a wrapper
  fix — it materialised every entry in the tree before anything counted them —
  so it grew a count primitive of its own, `collect_up_to`, that lets
  `BcacheFsAdapter::list` refuse *before* it allocates, the way `TmpFs` already
  does. `/home` was writable by userland, so it was a live panic path.

## What this type does not answer

Recorded so nobody tries to make it. One entry in this area was **not** this
class, and wrapping something would have touched it:

- **netd trusting the ring's closed flags** — a *predicate* a peer writes, not
  an index. `RingHeader::flags` lives in the page `SYS_PIPE_MAP` maps writable,
  and netd read `is_reader_closed`/`is_writer_closed` as facts about its peer.
  There was no bound to compare a bit against, so the answer was not a wrapper
  but to stop reading a publication as a channel: netd now asks the kernel's own
  `readers`/`writers` counts, which surface as EOF on a read and `BrokenPipe` on
  a write. Closed on its own file.

A second entry used to stand beside it: virtio-net registering its whole
`DmaPool` page, so that the claimant mapped the descriptor tables writable. That
was a *mapping* rather than a value, no read-side type helped while it stood,
and it was closed on 2026-08-23 by splitting the pool — which is why this
section names one entry and not two.

## What this type is not about

It carries no *time* and no *rate*, and nothing in it reasons about how long
anything takes. The TCG-versus-KVM p90 divergence PR #119 measured (4–8× in p90,
20× in max for scheduler pass cost on the dev host) does not reach any bound
here: every one is a byte count, a table length or a register encoding, and each
is compared against a number the driver itself published in the same function.
Recorded so that nobody re-checks it.
