# The kernel's console tag is composed by replacing the ABI formatter's first byte

One formatter lives in `toyos-abi`, beside the record, so the kernel's console
sink, the panel, `logd` and any diagnostic tool produce byte-identical text from
one implementation. `Display for LogRecord` renders

```
[0.123 cpu0 tid=3] the message
```

and the kernel's console line has always been

```
[kernel 0.123 cpu0 tid=3] the message
```

— the same line with a tag *inside* the bracket. So the sink cannot simply
prepend: the formatter's first byte is the bracket the tag has to go through.
`kernel/src/log/console.rs`'s `Line::write_str` therefore strips a leading `[`
from the first fragment and writes `[kernel ` in its place.

## Why it is like that

**`toyos-abi/src` is sysroot source** (`src/toolchain.rs`'s `SYSROOT_SOURCES`),
so a branch that touches it claims the shared sysroot from its first build until
it lands, and `pr::abi_lands_alone` refuses a branch that mixes an ABI commit
with work that depends on it. The log architecture's ABI landed as its own first
commit and this branch may not reopen it. Re-deriving the fields kernel-side was
the alternative and is the thing the single formatter exists to prevent — two
implementations of one line, and the panel is the one that would drift.

## The ABI half is in the tree; the kernel half is what is left

`LogRecord::tagged(&self, tag: &str) -> Tagged<'_>` exists, and `Display` is
`fmt_with_tag(f, "")` over the same private renderer — one implementation, and
`a_tag_goes_through_the_bracket_and_an_empty_one_changes_nothing` holds the
empty tag to `Display`'s bytes.

What remains is the consumer, and it is kernel-side, so it could not ride the
ABI landing: `kernel/src/log/console.rs`'s `Line::write_str` still strips a
leading `[` from the first fragment and writes `[kernel ` in its place. It
should call `record.tagged("kernel")` and lose both the `strip_prefix` and the
`tagged` flag. `logd` wants the same wrapper for its own wall-clock prefix, so
the kernel PR has two call sites to convert.

## What it is not

It is not a silent failure mode. If the formatter's leading bracket ever goes,
the fragment passes through whole and the line reads `[kernel [0.123 …` — wrong
and visible — rather than losing its first character.

## Also here: an early record now carries `cpu0`

Composition changed one thing about the line, deliberately. The byte ring's
prefix wrote `[kernel 0.001 boot]` for a record written before per-CPU was
ready; the record renders `[kernel 0.001 cpu0 boot]`, because cpu0's shard *is*
the boot shard and the ABI writes the origin before the flag. No test reads that
field and the new form says strictly more. Recorded because "byte for byte what
it is today" is the ruling this sits under, and this is the byte it is not.
