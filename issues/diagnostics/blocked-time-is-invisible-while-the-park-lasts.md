# A thread's blocked time does not exist until the park ends

`ProcessStats`'s five `blocked_*_ns` counters are charged at the transition
*out* of `Blocked`: `Task::charge_residency(now, Residency::Blocked(class))`
runs from `BlockedTask::wake`, which is the wake or the deadline fire. A thread
that is parked **right now** therefore contributes nothing for the park it is
in, however long it has been in it.

`cpu_ns` does not have this shape. `TaskHandle::cpu_ns` adds the live slice
itself — `base + now − running_since` — with its own doc explaining why: "so the
number does not stand still between passes". Blocked time stands still.

**Why it matters is the question the counters exist for.** The breakdown was
built for the T14 wedge investigation, where "this process is blocked" was
already known and *what it is blocked on, and for how long* was the question. A
`ps` taken during the wedge reads zeroes for every thread still inside the wait —
which is every thread the reader cares about. The instrument answers about waits
that have already ended, and a wedge is a wait that has not.

Found while writing `process_stats`' fourth arm, whose first draft read the
counters off a live parked child and got `0` for every class. That arm now ends
the park before it asks, and says so; the gap is here rather than worked around
silently.

**Pre-existing, and not the completion cutover's.** `charge_residency` and its
three residencies predate it. What the cutover changed is which *class* the park
is charged to (`WaitClass` is the wait's now, named at the arm), not when.

The fix has the same shape as `cpu_ns`'s and is not free: a reader would need
the park's `since` stamp and its class from the owning CPU, and a `CpuSched` is
`!Sync` — `sched::dump`'s `for_each_parked` reaches only the calling CPU.
`TaskHandle` is the cross-CPU face and could publish `(class, since)` at the
park the way it publishes `running_since` at the dispatch, which is two relaxed
stores on the park path. Whether that is worth two stores per park is the
measurement whoever takes this owes.

## Promoted 2026-08-25

Still true (verified 2026-08-25 against `kernel/src/sched/payload.rs`): a
parked thread's blocked time is invisible until the park ends, exactly
backwards for reading a wedge in progress. A scoped fix is named. Owed to
whoever next extends the diagnostics the T14 wedge investigation started.

## Two corrections, 2026-09-01

**The Ctrl+Alt+D report already answers this and is not the site.** `report_this_cpu`
prints `task.class.name()` and `Ms(now.saturating_sub(task.since))` for a task
that is still parked (`kernel/src/sched/dump.rs:376-381`), reading
`ParkedInfo::since` — "When the park began" (`kernel/src/sched/driver.rs:830`).
The live interval and its class are both there.

**`SYS_PROCESS_STATS` misses more than the park in progress.**
`ProcessData::accounting`'s five `blocked_*_ns` fields are written by
`merge_accounting` (`kernel/src/sched/payload.rs:218-223`) alone, and it has two
callers: `TaskHandle::merge_into` (`payload.rs:194`), reached only from
`retire_threads` (`kernel/src/process.rs:1051`), and `flush_current_stats`
(`kernel/src/scheduler.rs:679`), reached only from the thread's own teardown
(`kernel/src/process.rs:929`). A live thread's `TaskAccounting` reaches
`stats_from` at neither. So a live process's breakdown carries its *retired*
threads' parks only: every park a still-live thread has already finished is
invisible too, not merely the one it is in. Publishing `(class, since)` at the
park closes the smaller half; the larger half is a live thread's completed
parks reaching a cross-CPU reader at all.
