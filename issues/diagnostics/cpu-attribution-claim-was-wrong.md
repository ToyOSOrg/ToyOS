# CPU attribution: the recorded "half the CPU is unattributed" claim was wrong

**Its sign was backwards.** Investigated 2026-07-29.
`stop_cpu_timer` adds *one* delta to both the
per-thread `cpu_ns` that `ps` reads and the per-CPU `CPU_TIME_NS` that
`SYS_SYSINFO` reports as busy — they are one accumulator, not two measurements.
Genuinely unattributed kernel time is therefore absent from **both** numerators
and cannot open a gap between them; it pushes the 97% *down*, so true busy
**exceeds** 97%.

The 45-vs-97 gap is reader-side: `ps` divides a since-thread-creation cumulative
by since-boot uptime (`userland/toybox/src/ps.rs:54-56`) while the compositor
taskbar computes a correct one-second delta
(`userland/compositor/src/main.rs:1512-1518`) — a lifetime average against an
instantaneous sample — plus per-row flooring via `as u32` (up to a point per row,
12–20 rows) and reaped processes whose time stays in the system total forever but
vanishes from every row. The recorded prime suspect was also wrong: `mov cr3`
happens *after* `start_cpu_timer`, so the address-space switch is charged to the
incoming task, not lost.

`ps` already fetches `total_cpu_ns` at sysinfo bytes 32..40 and ignores it;
`header total_cpu_ns − Σ(printed cpu_ns)` is exactly the reaped+zombie loss,
measurable today with no kernel change. Real unattributed windows do exist — the
scheduler's pick-and-arm window (deliberate, documented) and the whole idle-loop
body, which does substantial work and is counted as idle — but they are smaller
and different from what the old entry claimed.

## Promoted 2026-08-25

A real, located bug remains (verified 2026-08-25, still at the described
site): `ps`'s `%CPU` divides a lifetime cumulative by boot uptime instead of a
windowed delta, unlike the compositor taskbar's correct one-second delta.
Owed to whoever next touches `userland/toybox/src/ps.rs`.
