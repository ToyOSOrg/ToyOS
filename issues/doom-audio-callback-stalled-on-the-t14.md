# Nothing explains why doom's audio callback stalled on the T14

doom's sound producer can no longer kill the game when its callback stops
consuming, and that is the whole of what is now known. **Why the callback stopped on the
owner's machine, about five seconds into play, is not.** The evidence is one
abort message, because the process that would have carried the answer is the
one that died.

An audio client's RT standing is *lent*, not held: soundd claims the audio
device, takes the RT band with it (`main.rs:705`), and every pipe write it
makes lends the woken reader a one-quantum window (`wake_pipe_readers`).
**On a machine with no audio device none of that happens.** The null
sink deliberately does not request the band — it protects no audible output —
so `driver::current_is_rt()` is false at its `signal_clients` write and the
client's callback thread is woken as an ordinary thread. The T14 has no audio
device. So the one thing that keeps a 2.9 ms deadline met was absent there and
is present in every config the suite runs.

That is a mechanism, not a measurement, and two others are equally live: the
`drain_irqs` entry, `issues/scheduler-pass-blocks-in-xhci.md`,
where any syscall on that thread can become the USB
driver's engine for as long as a second; and plain scheduling pressure from a
game thread and a compositor that never yield to it.

What would decide it is the callback's own period count against wall clock, on
that machine.
