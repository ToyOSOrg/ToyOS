# The fork estate is invisible to the zero-warning bar

Cargo passes `--cap-lints allow` to every package whose source is not a *path*
source. All 14 forks in `forks.toml` are consumed as git dependencies, so rustc
discards their warnings before anything can print them. Measured on `sshd`'s
graph: 140 of 143 units capped, the three exceptions being the local path crates
`sshd`, `toyos` and `toyos_abi`.

This is not a build-system defect and no build-system change can reach it. The
build system used to swallow cargo's diagnostics on success as well — that is
fixed — and the forks stayed invisible, because the cap is applied by cargo
upstream of anything `src/build.rs` does.

The trap to avoid is `[lints]` inside a fork: it is a manifest change, so it
lands in `git log <base>..toyos` and would put ToyOS lint policy into every
upstream PR the estate sends. The same objection rules out a cargo config inside
a fork checkout, and `RUSTFLAGS`, which would apply `-Dwarnings` to the whole
graph including untouched upstream crates.

**Turning each fork into a path source is the only thing that lifts the cap**,
so running the audit means cloning all 14 beside the monorepo and adding
overrides — which changes what every build in the repo resolves, so it needs a
quiet tree. Cover every patch site, not just userland. Then one full build with
the complete output captured to a file: expect real volume, because tokio,
winit, russh and cpal are large and their ToyOS deltas have never been linted
once. Triage against the fork rule — a warning in upstream's own code is not
ours and must not be "fixed", because that inflates the delta; only warnings
inside ToyOS-added modules and `target_os = "toyos"` arms are actionable.
Restore the overrides afterwards; they are dev-only and must never be committed.
(`cargo build -vv` also defeats the cap, but only by dumping every rustc command
line, which at this scale is unusable.)

**The standing mechanism is an open question, and "fix it later in the build
system" is not one of the answers** — the build system cannot see these warnings
at all. The honest options are a periodic path-override audit run deliberately,
or accepting that fork hygiene is a review-time concern checked when a fork is
updated. Pick one.

This is one instance of a wider shape: the estate is outside every check the
tree runs on itself. It is also invisible to ABI signature changes until a build
breaks, and it can hold frozen copies of first-party crates — a fork was found
depending on `toyos-abi` by git rather than by version on 2026-08-01, a
substantially different ABI (seven files the monorepo lacked, two the monorepo
had that it lacked) sitting inert in a cargo cache, never live but never
reported either. Each instance was found by accident or by a build breaking;
none by a check. **"I enumerated the call sites" is only true if the
enumeration covered `~/.cargo/git/checkouts/`** — grepping the monorepo is a
partial enumeration that reads as complete, and it cost every agent a blocked
workspace once already.
