# `tests/test-durations` is measured on one instrument and enforced on another

`src/tiers.rs`'s `FAST_CEILING_MS` reds any `Tier::Fast` name a run measures
over 10,000 ms. The profile it is judged against was measured by **twelve
GitHub-hosted shards**; the run that does the judging is now **one lane on the
T14**. The two do not price the same tests alike, so the gate reds on `main`'s
own tip, on a different set of names every run.

## What reds

`xhci_full_speed_device` is `Tier::Fast`, committed at `6900` ms.

| run | tree | where | shape | ms | names over the ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32444411794 (nightly, 03:43Z) | `da98b18b` | hosted, EPYC 7763/9V74, 4 cores | `--shard 6/12` | 6,900 | — (this run *is* the profile) |
| 32505371471 (merge queue, 16:54Z) | `13953023` | hosted, same | `--shard i/12` | **6,845** | **0** — green |
| 32498159547 (push, 15:32Z) | `07f89c8b` | T14, i5-1135G7, 8 cores | `--shard 1/1` | **11,076** | 9 |
| 32506479551 (push, 17:07Z) | `13953023` | T14, same | `--shard 1/1` | **12,156** | 5 |
| 32513441183 (PR #199, 18:27Z) | `c670ea27` | T14, same | `--shard 1/1` | **10,166** | 1 |
| 32524769419 (PR #201, 20:40Z) | `84bf0861` | T14, same | `--shard 1/1` | **9,052** | 1 — `i8042_health` at 15,122 |

**The last row is the whole argument.** PR #201 is this file and one
`src/redlist.rs` data row — a Markdown document and a `const` array entry,
nothing a kernel compiles. On it `xhci_full_speed_device` came in under the
ceiling, and the gate reded anyway: `i8042_health` at 15,122 ms against a
committed 9,509. Four consecutive lanes, four different casts over the line, on
trees whose differences cannot reach a boot.

The cast over the line rotates run to run — `dump_nmi_probe`,
`esp_filesystem`, `i8042_health`, `log_conservation_smp4`,
`log_partition_identity`, `sched_check_build`, `screen_console_clear`,
`screen_console_panic`, `xhci_full_speed_device`, `xhci_superspeed_ports`,
`xhci_two_controllers` — and the whole lane's measured test time with it: the
same 1/1 shape measured 429.2 s, 483.6 s and 548.8 s of tests on three
consecutive runs. The names that cross are simply the ones the profile already
prices nearest the line; the lane runs longest-first, so they are also the ones
that happen to sit at positions 174–202 of 275.

## What changed, and it is not the tree

`985f3834` ("Route trusted Linux CI to the T14 runner", #187, 10:50Z) made
`.github/workflows/route.yml` the one place that decides where a Linux job
runs. A trusted event — a push to `main`, a same-repository pull request, the
nightly — now takes `runner=toyos` with `matrix.shard: [1]` and
`SHARD_COUNT: 1`. Only a fork's pull request and a **merge-queue** ref stay on
`ubuntu-24.04` with the twelve-way matrix. `route.yml` did not exist at
`da98b18b`, which is why the 03:43Z nightly that recorded this profile ran
twelve hosted shards.

So the 6,900 ms and the 10,166 ms were taken on different silicon in different
partitions. Three independent lines say the tree between them is innocent:

1. **The same tree in the baseline's own shape.** Merge-queue run
   `32505371471` has `headSha` `13953023` — `main`'s tip, carrying every
   landing in the window — and ran twelve hosted shards. It measured
   `xhci_full_speed_device` at **6,845 ms**, 0.8% *under* the commitment, put
   **no** Fast name over the ceiling, and was green. Over the 84 names the
   profile prices at ≥ 1 s, that run's ratio to the committed profile has
   median 1.00.
2. **The window, sampled nine times in that shape.** The merge-queue runs from
   11:24Z to 16:54Z measured 8021, 8047, 8084, 7248, 7141, 7198, 7073, 7160 and
   6845 ms. The series trends *down*, and never approaches 10,000.
3. **The code.** `git diff da98b18b..13953023 -- kernel/src/drivers/
   toyos-xhci/ bootloader/` is empty: the xHCI driver and the whole device
   layer are byte-identical across the window. The only shipping-kernel changes
   are `kernel/src/object/handle.rs` (#171), `kernel/src/arch/syscall.rs`
   (#172's `POWER` demand on `SYS_SHUTDOWN`, and #171's debug action), and
   #192/#195's tripwires — every one of the latter behind
   `#[cfg(feature = "heap-tripwire")]` or `#[cfg(feature = "heap-sweep")]`, and
   neither feature is in `src/build.rs`'s `TEST_SUITE_KERNEL_BUILDS`
   (`["", "boot-actuators,test-actuators", "fpu-save-nothing", "sched-check"]`).
   What is left un-`cfg`'d is two `if let Some(..)` blocks in
   `hw::report_contexts` — the kernel crash report, not a boot path — whose
   callees are `#[cfg(not(..))] -> None`, plus the no-op
   `tripwire::{outer,arm,disarm}` shims in `GlobalAlloc::{alloc,dealloc}`.

## The T14, both trees, interleaved

The test alone, `--jobs 1 --host-slots 0`, in the CI image by digest on an idle
T14, twenty reps per arm taken as four interleaved blocks of five. No block was
discarded and no CI job container appeared during any of them.

| arm | tree | n | min | p25 | median | p75 | max | mean | sd |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAIN | `13953023` | 20 | 8,858 | 9,217 | **9,305** | 9,607 | 10,756 | 9,425 | 426 |
| NIGHT | `da98b18b` | 20 | 8,810 | 9,207 | **9,431** | 9,783 | 10,156 | 9,467 | 350 |

Median difference −126 ms (−1.3%), Mann-Whitney U = 170 against µ = 200,
z = −0.81, two-sided **p = 0.42**. By the gate's own statistic the two arms are
identical: each put 2 of 20 reps over the 10,000 ms ceiling.

**The tree that recorded 6,900 ms costs 9,431 ms on the T14.** Both arms are
1.35–1.37× the committed price, alone and uncontended — so roughly a third of
the gap is the machine, and the rest is the lane: inside the 1/1 partition the
same test measured 10,166–12,156 ms in the three CI runs above.

The old tree was **not** measured inside a 1/1 lane. That arm was started and
abandoned: one lane rep is ~8 minutes, the T14 has one worker, and CI wanted
the machine — a measuring container that holds the lane against a `guest` job
is the stuck slot, so it yielded. Nothing here rests on it. The alone arm is
the controlled tree-versus-tree comparison, and the lane multiplier is a
property of the partition rather than of a tree.

## The ruling: one profile, one instrument

**The orchestrator chose the second of the three options below, 2026-08-21: the
profile has one instrument, so only that instrument renders the tier verdict.**
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `durations` job now reads
`needs.route.outputs.trusted` — the same output `guest` keys its `runs-on`,
matrix and shard count on, and never `runner.name`, since `durations` is
GitHub-hosted on every event and its own runner says nothing about where the
measurement was taken. On a T14 lane (`trusted == 'yes'`) it still merges, still
prints the critical-path line and the unpriced/unrun names into the step
summary, and still uploads `test-durations-merged`; the price verdict is printed
as a `::warning::` naming the reason and the job exits 0. On a merge-queue ref
or a fork's pull request — hosted, the shape the profile was taken in — nothing
changes and the verdict fails exactly as before. The queue is required before
`main` moves, so the verdict is still rendered on every landing. (**That last
sentence stopped being true on 2026-08-22** — see the amendment below: a landing
renders the verdict only for the names it touched, and the nightly renders all
of them.)

The three options as they stood, for the record:

* re-measure the profile on the instrument that now enforces it, and accept
  that a 1/1 lane whose totals swing 429 s → 549 s will red on a rotating cast
  of names anyway;
* **keep the profile hosted — the merge queue still measures that shape — and
  stop letting the T14 lane write a verdict against it;** ← taken
* or price the ceiling per instrument.

`src/durations.rs`'s module header now carries the rule and the measurements
behind it, and `src/ci.rs`'s
`the_softened_duration_verdict_is_the_one_the_merge_actually_raises` holds the
workflow's match string against `durations::TIER_DISAGREEMENT`, because the
telling-apart is a shell string against a Rust string and rewording the panic
would otherwise leave both files reading perfectly while the workflow stopped
recognising the one verdict it may soften.

**Only the price verdict moved.** The T14 lane's suite run gates every test's
verdict exactly as before, `tests/test-durations` and `src/tiers.rs`'s rules are
untouched, and there is no second profile. Every other refusal
`--merge-durations` can raise — a duplicate execution label, a short shard set,
an erased Fast label, a committed `UNMEASURED` marker past its one bought run —
is a fact about the tree or the partition rather than about machine speed, and
still reds on either instrument. Six arms of the step were driven against a
stubbed merge before landing: a T14 tier refusal exits 0 with the warning; the
same refusal hosted, a `may not land` marker refusal on the T14, a duplicate
label on the T14, and a tier refusal with the routing output empty (a failed or
skipped `route`) all still exit 101.

## Closed 2026-08-21: the nightly gap

**The orchestrator's ruling: the nightly refreshes the profile, so it runs
where the profile lives.** `route.yml`'s `HOSTED` expression now carries one
more clause: `github.event_name == 'schedule' && github.workflow == 'ci'`.
`github.workflow` is the calling workflow's name even from inside a reusable
workflow, so this reaches `ci.yml`'s own `schedule` — and only that one —
without touching gate A's `10 3 * * *` or portability's `15 3 * * *`, which
stay trusted (T14) exactly as before; `workflow_dispatch` is untouched on
every workflow, so it stays the T14's manual lane on purpose. `ci.yml`'s
nightly `schedule` is now routed hosted, exactly like a merge-queue ref:
twelve GitHub-hosted shards, `debian:sid`, `SUITE_TIER_ARGS` still widened to
`--nightly` (that switch never read `trusted`), `tcg` still hosted on the same
event, `nightly-red`'s own `needs:`/`if:` untouched. `cache-writer` was and
stays `skipped` on `schedule` by its own explicit
`github.event_name != 'schedule'` guard, unrelated to `trusted`.

So the instrument that recorded `tests/test-durations` is the instrument that
now refreshes it: `durations`'s `GUEST_LANE_TRUSTED` reads `no` on a nightly
run again, the softened-warning branch in the ruling above does not fire, and
the price verdict renders for real on every nightly, the same as it does on
the merge queue. **The gap this file's "What remains" named — no instrument
matching the profile produces a fresh Nightly number at all — is closed.**
Verified by construction (`gh workflow run` cannot exercise `schedule`, so
there is no dispatched run to point at): the `HOSTED` expression traced by
hand through the affected consumers, `cargo test --lib` green throughout.
Prospective until the first hosted nightly actually runs, 2026-08-22 03:00Z.

## 2026-08-22: the enforcing instrument is the measuring one again

The routing was moved for a different reason — the T14's one worker had
thirteen runs of branch traffic queued behind one nightly gate A, measured
2026-08-22T05:03Z and recorded in `route.yml`'s own header — and this file is
downstream of it. `route.yml`'s `HOSTED` now
covers `merge_group`, `pull_request` from anywhere, `push`, and `ci.yml`'s
`schedule`; only a `workflow_dispatch` and a non-`ci.yml` `schedule` reach the
T14.

So the gap this file is about is now a corner rather than the common case: a
pull request's guest lane is twelve hosted shards again, which is the shape
`tests/test-durations` was measured in, and the price verdict renders for real
on the run that introduces a name. The softening in `ci.yml`'s `durations` job
stays, because a dispatched T14 lane is still a whole partition measured on the
wrong instrument, and `src/ci.rs`'s
`the_softened_duration_verdict_is_the_one_the_merge_actually_raises` still holds
the match string. Two of the three bullets below moved with it:

* the `UNMEASURED` round trip takes its one bought measurement on the hosted
  shards again, on the pull request itself, so an author no longer commits a
  T14 number into a hosted profile or waits for the merge queue to adjudicate
  one;
* `src/redlist.rs`'s `xhci_full_speed_device` row is a record of four T14 lanes
  that a pull request no longer runs.

What is unchanged is the fact this file exists for: `tests/test-durations` holds
one number per test with no record of which machine took it, and the two
machines that wear `Instrument::Ci` do not price alike. A dispatch, a nightly
gate A, or any future routing that puts a lane back on the T14 meets it again.

## Amended 2026-08-22: a second axis, which names

The ruling above is about *which instrument* may render the price verdict, and
it stands. A second axis was added beside it, and it is what makes the sentence
"the verdict is still rendered on every landing" false: **a landing renders the
price verdict only for the names it registered or re-tiered.**
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `durations` job passes `--tier-base <sha>` from
`github.event.merge_group.base_sha` or `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`, and
`src/durations.rs` refuses a price verdict only for names whose registration row
in `tests/toyos.rs` or whose `Why` in `src/tiers.rs`'s `RELEGATED` differs from
the base's. Every other price verdict prints as a `::warning::` and the job exits
0. The nightly — twelve hosted shards since the section above — passes no base
and refuses them all.

The reason is a different measurement from this file's. This file measures two
*machines* (twelve hosted EPYC shards against one T14 lane, 1.35–1.37x apart);
`issues/build/a-shards-boot-width-does-not-price-its-tests.md` measures the
spread *within* the hosted lane: a per-shard common price factor explaining 57%
of a name's run-to-run variance with a p10–p90 spread of about 1.28x, unrelated
to the shard's boot width. Under the required merge queue, a price verdict on a
name nobody in the composition touched dequeues the whole composition — which is
what merge-queue run `32550410305` did on `xhci_full_speed_device` at 9,890 ms.

The two axes compose and neither replaces the other: the T14 softening still
applies to whatever refusal survives the base, and everything this file already
says is a fact about the tree or the partition — a duplicate execution label, a
short shard set, an erased Fast label, a committed `UNMEASURED` marker past its
one bought run — is refused at every base as well as on every machine.

## What remains

* **`src/redlist.rs`'s `xhci_full_speed_device` row is now about a warning.**
  Its evidence — four consecutive T14 lanes reding four different names — is
  unchanged and it is still what a reader of the warning should check; the
  refusal it describes simply no longer fails the job on a T14 lane. That row's
  `source` is this file.
* **`src/redlist.rs`'s `Instrument::Ci` doc is fixed and the profile's own
  instrument is not.** The enum now says two machines wear that name and do not
  price alike. `tests/test-durations` still holds one number per test with no
  record of which machine took it.
* **The `UNMEASURED` round trip now takes its one bought measurement on the
  T14.** A new Fast name's marker still reds on a T14 lane by design, and the
  measured value the author is told to commit comes from that lane's artifact —
  a T14 number entering a hosted profile. A branch in this repository cannot get
  a hosted twelve-shard measurement at all except by entering the merge queue,
  so the number is adjudicated there rather than on the pull request. This is
  about a branch's pull request, not about `schedule`, so the routing change
  above does not touch it.

`cargo run -- --known-red xhci_full_speed_device` answers with the row this
issue is the source of, so an author who meets the refusal does not re-derive
the above.
