# No test distinguishes the crash-report preemption fix from a no-op

`bd12795` rests on reading the code, which is the weakest standard this project
accepts. Staging it needs a crash report whose preempt count returns to zero with
`need_resched` set — a timing coincidence the harness cannot ask for. The three
panic-path tests still passing says only that nothing regressed.

Fourth instance this session of a fix that was never broken and re-run, and the
only one of the four where that check is genuinely hard rather than merely
skipped. Recorded so it is not mistaken for the same tested standard as the
fixes around it.
