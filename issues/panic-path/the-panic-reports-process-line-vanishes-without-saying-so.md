# A panic report's `Process:` line vanishes without saying so

`crash_report_panic` (`kernel/src/arch/idt/exceptions.rs`) prints the faulting
process's name and teardown state from the process table, under a `try_lock` it
is right not to turn into a wait:

```rust
if let Some(guard) = process::PROCESS_TABLE.try_lock() {
    if let Some(table) = guard.as_ref() {
        if let Some(proc) = table.get(pid) {
            log!("  Process: {} pid={} state={}", ...);
        }
    }
}
```

Three `if let`s and no `else`. When the `try_lock` loses, the line is simply not
there, and nothing in the report says a line was owed — which is the shape
`process::SymbolLookup` exists to make unwritable for a symbol, one function
over. A reader of a report with no `Process:` line cannot tell "the table was
held" from "this pid is not in the table" from "there is no such line in this
kind of report".

`process::dump_crash_diagnostics` is the same `try_lock` done honestly:
`[crash diagnostics: PROCESS_TABLE locked, skipping]`.

## Why it is a finding and not a defect

Nothing measured it losing. It is one line, and everything it carries but the
*name* is elsewhere in the same report (`Running: pid=… tid=…` is printed
immediately above it, from percpu, with no lock). The name is worth having and
worth an `else` — the fix is two lines — but no gate asserts on the line today
and no run on record is missing it.

Found while removing the symbol lookup's dependency on the same table (PR #239,
`kernel/src/process.rs`'s module header). Not fixed there: that change is about
names, and this is a different line with no measurement behind it.

**Promoted to `defect` 2026-08-25** (finding-lifecycle ruling). A report that
drops a line it owed without saying so is the shape `dump_crash_diagnostics`
already refuses to have one function over, and the fix the entry names is two
lines — an `else` that says the table was held. That no run on record has lost
the line is why it is small, not why it is not owed. Owed by whoever next
touches `crash_report_panic` in `kernel/src/arch/idt/exceptions.rs`.
