# A double panic at boot's edge, and it says nothing but its name

Two findings in one sighting, dev host under load (two worktrees' full
suites interleaved over the shared twelve guest slots), 2026-08-19 22:21 UTC.
`src/redlist.rs` carries the row.

**1. The kernel double-panicked under load.** `log_poll_outlives_a_close`,
parallel phase, 25 s: the guest went quiet with every CPU halted, and the
harness's verdict names it — "the panic is the finding and the guard never got
to be one." Alone the same test is green; the harness notes the run stays red
on the classification. Reclassifying the test would bury the real story: some
first panic fired near `t=0.991 s` on cpu0 — boot's edge, where the log ring,
its drains and the poll registration all come up — and then the panic path
panicked too. The log subsystem's known sins live in exactly that
neighbourhood (an unbounded `BackendGuard::lock` spin with interrupts off is
one of the redesign track's own exhibits), and the redesign is approved and
sequenced; this sighting is evidence for it, and a reproduction recipe:
`cargo test` in two worktrees at once.

**2. The double-panic path reports nothing.** *(Resolved 2026-08-20.)* The
kernel's complete last words were `[kernel 0.991 cpu0] DOUBLE PANIC` — not what
the first panic said, not where, not what the second one was. A report that
names a kernel death is the tree's own fresh standard for the harness side; the
kernel side of a *double* panic has no report at all, so the one class of crash
that is by definition two bugs deep is the one class that leaves no evidence.
Even a fixed-size, pre-reserved line naming the first panic's location would
have turned this sighting from a mystery into a lead.

`kernel/src/panic.rs` is that line. The first crash on a CPU — a panic's site
and literal message, or a fatal exception's name, `rip` and `cr2` — is copied
into a pre-reserved static before either report runs, and both dead ends
(`DOUBLE PANIC` and the reentry guard) emit it: raw out the 16550 first,
because the log path is what may be held, and then as a record, because the
panel is the only channel a laptop has. The line also names *which* state the
arriving panic found, which is the fact this sighting most wanted:
`DOUBLE PANIC` with the depth guard at zero means the first event was a fault
or a demand-paging fault and not a panic at all.
`double_panic_names_the_first` stages both dead ends and reads them.

**Finding 1 stays open**, and the next sighting of it will carry what this one
could not: the first crash's identity and site, the second panic's site, and
the state the CPU was in when it arrived. What this sighting still does not
establish is what that first crash was. The capture is
`scratchpad/hkpfix-harness.log` in the 2026-08-20 orchestrator session; the
durable evidence is quoted here and in the redlist row.

## What closes it is a count, and the count is owed

There is a leading explanation and it is not this entry's to argue: the
`log_poll_outlives_a_close` row in `src/redlist.rs` records it as the
already-fixed missing-`cld` class, with the before/after boot counts that make
the case, and reasons that a machine-wide death at boot's edge under two suites
on a branch carrying no kernel byte is that class's shape. It is not shown here,
so the row stands and so does this.

**Nothing about it is a decision.** The row names its own retirement condition —
three loaded suites of the fixed tree with no red under this name — and that is
an instrument run: `cargo test` in two worktrees at once, three times, with the
result read rather than argued. Checked 2026-08-24 and still owed; the row's own
note records why the first attempt did not happen on 2026-08-22. A closing pass
cannot supply it, because a suite run beside five other agents' suites is a
loaded host that nobody can characterise afterwards — the instrument needs the
machine, not a spare slot on it.
