//! Loom harness for the kernel's memory-ordering primitives.
//!
//! `kernel/src/sync.rs`, `kernel/src/shootdown.rs`,
//! `kernel/src/sched/reap_gate.rs` and `kernel/src/drivers/i8042/tally.rs` are
//! compiled into this crate with `feature = "loom"` on, so their atomics and
//! cells resolve to loom's instrumented ones and the models drive the real
//! primitives rather than transliterations of them — a transliteration is
//! exactly the divergence risk a model checker is meant to remove. What the
//! kernel files name through `crate::` is supplied below: the lock takes a
//! preempt count and a log macro from its environment, and neither is what the
//! models are about; `shootdown.rs`, `reap_gate.rs` and `tally.rs` name nothing
//! at all, which is why none of the three has a shim here.
//!
//! Scope for the lock, stated because it is narrower than the file: the models
//! drive `try_lock` and `LockGuard::drop`. `lock()`'s spin cannot be modelled —
//! loom explores a spin as an unbounded branch and gives up ("Model exceeded
//! maximum number of branches"), and the `yield_now` that would fix it belongs
//! to loom rather than to a kernel that really does spin. The shootdown's spins
//! *are* modelled, because they live in the caller — `arch::tlb` — and the model
//! writes its own.
//!
//! **What that scope leaves certified by reading alone: contention on `lock()`
//! — the ticket ordering, and the FIFO fairness the ticket exists to buy.** The
//! *release* edge is shared, since both acquire paths end at the guard's
//! `now.fetch_add(1, Release)`, so publication is driven from either side; the
//! waiting side is not driven at all. Nothing in the guest suite substitutes for
//! it: x86's TSO gives every load acquire and every store release semantics, so
//! a missing edge in this primitive is invisible on the only architecture ToyOS
//! boots and becomes observable on ARM64, which is planned and not built. That
//! is why `try_lock`'s acquire edge sat on the wrong atomic through every green
//! suite run until a model checker was pointed at it.
//!
//! Every `loom::model` test file in this crate is gated `cfg(feature =
//! "loom")`, so the crate's two supported invocations are `cargo test`
//! (default features, every model) and `cargo test --no-default-features
//! --test <name>` naming only a file gated the other way round.
