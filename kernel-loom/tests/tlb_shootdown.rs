//! Loom: the shootdown acknowledgement's happens-before edges.
//!
//! The property under test is the one the whole stage exists for:
//!
//! > when an initiator is told that cpu 1 has flushed, cpu 1's translations
//! > already reflect the page-table write the initiator made before asking.
//!
//! A TLB is modelled as one cell holding what cpu 1's last page walk found, and
//! a flush is modelled as re-walking — the strongest thing a flush can be asked
//! to mean and the only one expressible here. So `UNMAPPED` after an
//! acknowledged shootdown is "cpu 1 can no longer reach the page the initiator
//! is about to free", and `MAPPED` is the use-after-free this stage removes.
//!
//! The edge the property rests on is `serve`'s load of what it owes: it
//! synchronizes with `issue`'s release, and that is what puts the initiator's
//! page-table write ahead of the flush. On x86 every load is an acquire, so a
//! build with it relaxed behaves identically to this one and no guest test can
//! fail here. The negative case is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel-loom/Cargo.toml --features shootdown-serve-relaxed \
//!   --test tlb_shootdown
//! ```
//!
//! makes that load relaxed and this file must red — *cpu 1 acknowledged the
//! shootdown while still holding a translation for the page the initiator is
//! about to free*, which is the use-after-free this stage removes, stated
//! exactly. Verified 2026-08-17, both ways round.
//!
//! **Every spin is bounded and every assertion is conditional on the ack having
//! arrived, so [`ACKED`] is what stops the models passing vacuously.** An
//! unbounded serve loop is the same trap `kernel-loom`'s lock models document:
//! loom explores it as an unbounded branch and never finishes. Safety is what
//! the bounded form checks, and safety is the whole property — liveness in the
//! kernel comes from the IPI being redelivered, which is hardware and not this
//! protocol.
