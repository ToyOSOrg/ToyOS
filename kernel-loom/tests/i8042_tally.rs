//! Loom: the i8042's interrupt tally.
//!
//! The driver prints `N interrupts and M bytes, nothing decoded` — a verdict
//! about *bytes* — and it decides whether to print it from how many interrupts
//! carried one. That was two counters the ISR wrote at either end of its
//! port-drain burst, subtracted by a reader on another CPU, and a reader landing
//! between the two writes blamed an interrupt that had carried nothing.
//!
//! **That torn read is not what produced the rate the write-up records.**
//! `i8042_undecoded_bytes` at about one full suite in three under load came from
//! the same handler counting on the way *in*, ahead of any byte reaching the
//! ring, which needs no subtraction at all — no reader could have been inside
//! the bring-up ISR's window: the reporting CPU was an AP, and `i8042::init`
//! runs on the BSP before `smp::boot_aps`.
//! One word closes both. The distinction is written here because blaming a
//! proved race for an observed line, without checking that a reader could have
//! been there, is the mistake this file exists downstream of.
//!
//! **A rate is why this is a model and not a test.** Either window is a handful
//! of instructions on one CPU; no guest boot can be made to land in one on
//! demand, and a green suite says nothing about whether it can still be landed
//! in. What the property actually is — *at no instant may a reader see an empty
//! interrupt counted as one that carried* — is a claim about every
//! interleaving, which is what loom enumerates.
//!
//! Three directions, and the third is the one that makes the first two mean
//! anything:
//!
//! * **The property.** An interrupt that delivered nothing is never counted as
//!   one that did, from any interleaving.
//! * **The cost it must not have.** An interrupt that *did* deliver is counted,
//!   and a reader that sees the count can see the bytes.
//! * **The teeth.** The same reader, against the shape this replaced, must
//!   actually observe the bad state. A model that has never seen a defect is a
//!   model nobody knows is exploring anything.
//!
//! **Both of the first two red when the two counters are put back**, measured by
//! putting them back: `Counts { carried: 1, empty: 0 }` for an interrupt that
//! carried nothing, and a count of an arrived byte with the byte not yet
//! published. That run is the evidence this file works and the evidence the fix
//! does; the guest suite can supply neither, because a rate is not falsified by
//! a green boot.
