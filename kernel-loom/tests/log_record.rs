//! Loom: the record ring's publication and recycle edges.
//!
//! **x86 gives every load acquire and every store release semantics, so none of
//! this can fail on the machine this tree is developed on.** A dropped
//! `Release` on the commit store, or a hoisted re-check in the reader, is
//! invisible to every guest test and to CI's KVM shards alike. ARM64 is planned
//! and would not forgive either. This is the only instrument in the tree that
//! sees them.
//!
//! `SHARD_RECORDS` is 4 here, which is what makes the recycle cases reachable
//! in a model at all — `shard.rs` says why.
//!
//! Three of the ring's memory-ordering obligations are modelled here. **W1**,
//! publication: the body stores precede the `Release` store of `seq`, so a
//! reader whose `Acquire` load sees the sequence number sees the whole body.
//! **W2**, recycle detection: the readable window is exactly the last
//! `SHARD_RECORDS` sequence numbers, and a slot a writer has re-entered answers
//! for neither generation. **W4**, the reservation: `head` is written by one CPU
//! through inline asm and read by every other as an `AtomicU64`. Loom cannot
//! model inline asm, so `percpu_fetch_add` is shimmed to a real `fetch_add` —
//! strictly stronger, because the only behaviour the real instruction has that
//! `fetch_add` does not is non-atomicity against another CPU's write, and the
//! commit bracket is what makes "no other CPU writes `head`" true.
//!
//! The negative case is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel-loom/Cargo.toml --features log-commit-release-off \
//!   --test log_record
//! ```
//!
//! drops the `Release` from `commit`'s publishing store — W1's own weakening —
//! and this file must red, at [`a_committed_record_is_whole_or_absent`] (*torn:
//! at_ns is another record's*) and at
//! [`a_key_and_the_record_it_names_come_from_one_generation`] (*a key from the
//! generation the slot used to hold*). Verified 2026-08-17, both ways round.
//! The other two weakenings this file catches — the `WRITING` mark with its
//! release fence, and either reader's acquire fence — are recorded on
//! [`a_reader_racing_a_recycle_gets_nothing_rather_than_a_mixture`] and are
//! mutations rather than features.
