//! Loom: **the record's publication, and Invariant W** — the two things a
//! completion has to get right and no guest test can see.
//!
//! The invariant, in one sentence: **after a post and a park decision, the
//! record is either in the taker's hands or the poster owns the wake.** Never
//! neither, which is a completion left under a parked task — a thread that
//! waits for something that already happened.
//!
//! Both halves are a store followed by a load of a *different* location, the
//! one reordering x86 TSO permits, so on the machine this kernel ships for a
//! build with the release removed behaves identically to one with it. **No
//! guest test can fail here, on any hardware this tree targets**, which is why
//! the obligation is a model and why the model ships in the same chunk as the
//! code. The negative case is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel-loom/Cargo.toml --features inbox-release-off \
//!   --test inbox
//! ```
//!
//! makes the publication relaxed and this file must red — loom answers
//! `Causality violation: Concurrent write accesses to UnsafeCell`, which is the
//! defect stated exactly. Verified 2026-08-16 and again 2026-08-19 after the
//! merge with `main`, both ways round; the step that runs it is
//! `host-tests.yml`'s "kernel-loom inbox publication has teeth", which demands
//! `a_record_reaches_its_taker_intact ... FAILED` by name.
//!
//! **Invariant W's own teeth are a mutation rather than a feature**, because
//! what would have to be broken is the *caller's* order and not a line in
//! `inbox.rs`: move the recheck above the registration in
//! `a_post_racing_a_park_leaves_nobody_waiting` — check-then-block, the window
//! the two-phase commit exists to close — and the model reds. Also verified
//! 2026-08-16.
//!
//! **What this model is not about.** The rendezvous that claims a waiter is
//! `toyos-sched`'s two-phase commit, and it has its own models in that crate;
//! re-deriving it here would only re-derive it badly. What stands in for it
//! below is a `SeqCst` flag, which is what the real `compare_exchange` gives
//! and no more. The subject's leaf lock is a `loom::sync::Mutex` for the same
//! reason: the kernel's poster really does hold one, and the inbox's plain
//! `tail` store is sound *because* of it.
//!
//! **Both sides are spawned threads on purpose.** Loom runs the model's own
//! thread first and explores preemptions from there, so a consumer written on
//! the main thread never observes a producer that has not run yet: the
//! interleaving that matters is not in the state space at all, and the model
//! passes vacuously. Measured while writing this file — the reader-on-main
//! form asserted `!has_record()` and *passed*, with the release in place.
