//! Loom: `Lock`'s acquire edges.
//!
//! `try_lock` decides ownership by CASing `ticket`, but the atomic an unlock
//! publishes through is `now`. Whichever operation reads `now` is therefore the
//! one that has to carry the acquire — an acquire on `ticket` synchronizes with
//! nothing, because nothing ever releases to `ticket`.
//!
//! On x86 every load is an acquire, so a build with that edge relaxed behaves
//! identically to this one and no guest test can fail here. The negative case is
//! a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel-loom/Cargo.toml --features lock-acquire-off \
//!   --test ticket_lock
//! ```
//!
//! makes `sync.rs`'s two loads of `now` relaxed and this file must red — loom
//! answers `Causality violation: Concurrent write accesses to UnsafeCell`, which
//! is a lock handing out data it did not synchronize, stated exactly. Verified
//! 2026-08-17, both ways round.
