//! Loom: `SleepLock`'s acquire edges, and the first *contended* acquire this
//! tree has ever modelled.
//!
//! `Lock::lock`'s spin is unreachable by loom — the model checker explores a
//! `core::hint::spin_loop` as an unbounded branch and gives up, which this
//! crate's own scope note and `kernel::sync`'s `ACQUIRED` both state, so
//! `ticket_lock.rs` can only drive `try_lock`. A parking acquire has no
//! unbounded branch: the contender gives the CPU back and loom's own
//! `yield_now` is a branch it can bound. So the path `ticket_lock.rs` cannot
//! reach is exactly the path this file is about.
//!
//! **What this proves and what it does not.** Loom has no scheduler, so the
//! park itself is shimmed
//! (`kernel_loom::completion::wait_uncancellable_until` yields). What is
//! therefore under test is the lock: the ticket arithmetic, mutual exclusion,
//! and the release-to-acquire edge that hands the next holder the previous
//! one's writes. What is **not** under test is the wake handshake — the
//! record-then-claim pair that makes a post reach a *parked* waiter, which is
//! `inbox.rs`'s model and is checked there against the real `Inbox`.
//!
//! Service order is FIFO by the arithmetic rather than by anything this file
//! observes: `now` is advanced exactly once per release and a contender waits
//! for the ticket it took, so ticket order *is* service order. There is no
//! interleaving that makes that false and none that makes it visible, so it is
//! stated here rather than asserted below.
//!
//! On x86 every load is an acquire, so a build with the edge relaxed behaves
//! identically to this one and no guest test can fail here. The negative case
//! is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel-loom/Cargo.toml --features sleeplock-acquire-off \
//!   --test sleep_lock
//! ```
//!
//! makes `sleeplock.rs`'s two loads of `now` relaxed and this file must red —
//! loom answers `Causality violation: Concurrent write accesses to UnsafeCell`,
//! which is a lock handing out data it did not synchronize, stated exactly.
//! Verified 2026-08-19, both ways round: all four models red under the feature
//! and all four pass without it. The step that runs it is `host-tests.yml`'s
//! "kernel-loom sleep lock's acquire edge has teeth", which demands
//! `a_parking_contender_observes_the_holders_writes` and
//! `two_holders_never_overlap` by name — the contended park and mutual
//! exclusion, the two the *ordering* breaks rather than the arithmetic.
