//! Host-fast regression for the AP shard's allocation path.
//!
//! Loom atomics are deliberately not byte-zeroable, so this test runs with
//! `--no-default-features` and exercises the real `core` layout and the real
//! in-place constructor used after `alloc_zeroed`.
//!
//! **The gate below therefore runs under exactly one of this crate's two
//! invocations, and the other one runs nothing from this file.** That is the
//! shape, not an accident — but it was silent until 2026-08-14, when CI ran
//! only the default invocation and this file's `running 0 tests` looked
//! identical to a pass. `.github/workflows/host-tests.yml` names both commands
//! now, and every other `loom::model` file is gated `cfg(feature = "loom")`,
//! so a bare `--no-default-features` run at the crate root exercises none of
//! them either — the second command names this target explicitly instead.
