//! Loom: **W3 — the wake edge**, and the one obligation the wake's own
//! correctness rests on.
//!
//! The invariant, in one sentence: **after a commit and an arm, at least one
//! side has seen the other.** Either the producer finds the flag and owns a
//! post, or the reader's rescan finds the record and does not park. Never
//! neither — that is a committed record left under a parked reader, which is a
//! console that has gone quiet with something still to say.
//!
//! Both halves are a store followed by a load of a *different* location, which
//! is the one reordering x86 TSO permits — so on the machine this kernel ships
//! for, a build with either `SeqCst` fence removed behaves identically to one
//! with both. **No guest test can fail here, on any hardware this tree
//! targets**, which is why the obligation is a model and why the model ships in
//! the same chunk as the code.
//!
//! **What this model is not about.** The park itself is `toyos-sched`'s
//! two-phase commit: `klogd` registers *before* it arms, so a producer that
//! wins the flag from that point on claims a `Committing` task and the task's
//! own commit refuses to park. That handshake has its own models in that crate,
//! and re-modelling it here would only re-derive it badly — the first draft of
//! this file did, with a plain `parked` word, and reported a lost wake that the
//! rendezvous CAS makes unreachable. What is left here is exactly the pair of
//! fences, which nothing else models.
//!
//! The negative case is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --manifest-path kernel-loom/Cargo.toml --features wake-fence-off \
//!   --test log_wake
//! ```
//!
//! removes both fences from `shard.rs` and this file must red. A model that has
//! never failed proves nothing.
