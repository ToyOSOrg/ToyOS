//! A value too wide for its line keeps both of its ends.
//!
//! **No bound on the record fixes an unbounded name.** A demangled Rust symbol
//! is bounded by nothing the kernel controls — `late_panic::Nest` is a generic
//! nested in itself and nothing stops it being nested again — so
//! `MAX_RECORD_MESSAGE` can only be raised until the *ordinary* line fits. What
//! is left is to decide which bytes of an over-wide one survive, and the answer
//! is both ends: the head is the crate and the module path, the tail is the
//! function, and a backtrace with only one of them names nothing.
//!
//! It is the **producer's** decision, so the record still holds a whole message
//! and `elided` still means what the ABI says it means.
//!
//! **That is also why this is not in `toyos-abi`**, where `elided` and the rest
//! of `LogRecord` live. The ABI is the contract between the kernel and
//! userland; this is one side deciding what to put in a field before it fills
//! it in, with one caller and nothing on the far side of the contract that
//! needs it — and `toyos-abi` is a dependency of `std`, so a formatter that
//! reaches no reader would ship in every program.
//!
//! Pure: `core::fmt` and nothing else — no allocation, no `unsafe`, and no
//! record. The one caller is `toyos-symbols`, which spends the budget
//! `MAX_RECORD_MESSAGE` leaves a backtrace frame on behalf of
//! `kernel/src/symbols.rs`, and everything it decides is
//! checked here on the host, where a seam falling inside a four-byte character
//! costs milliseconds and no guest at all — the tree's own widest symbol is
//! under a third of what triggers the elision, so no boot reaches it.
//!
//! **Naming nothing outside `core` is the property this crate has to keep to
//! stay testable**: a dependency added here is the code leaving the host, and
//! the tests go with it.
