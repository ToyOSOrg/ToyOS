/// belongs in this crate: the kernel's `BlockDevice` does I/O in 4096-byte
/// blocks, while an ESP's sectors are whatever its BPB says — usually 512. If
/// this trait spoke sectors, the implementor would have to know the BPB's
/// sector size to serve a request, and it cannot: parsing the BPB is what the
/// first call to this trait is *for*. Bytes are the only unit both sides agree
/// on before anything has been read.
///
/// So an implementor bridges to its own block size, including read-modify-write
/// for a partial block. `Fat32` reasons in BPB sectors and converts to byte
/// offsets at the boundary; nothing here assumes 512, or 4096, or any
/// particular alignment of a request.
///
/// Offsets are relative to the start of the volume, not the disk. A partition
/// is the implementor's business.
