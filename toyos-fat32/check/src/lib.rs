//! A FAT32 volume checker: the outside judge for every volume this project
//! writes.
//!
//! Written from Microsoft's *FAT32 File System Specification* (fatgen103,
//! version 1.03, 6 December 2000) and depending on neither `toyos-fat32` nor
//! `fatfs` — a checker sharing code with the writer it judges agrees with that
//! writer's bugs. Its dependency list is empty, which is the mechanical half of
//! that claim.
//!
//! It is deliberately stronger than the host `fsck_msdos` it stands in for, in
//! two places where that binary is silent and each of which cost this project a
//! defect every other gate passed: a **stale FAT mirror**, which fsck does not
//! compare and a mount never reads, and **duplicate 8.3 short names**, which
//! neither fsck nor a mount looks at because both use the long names. Dropping
//! short-name uniquification entirely was invisible to every gate there was.
//!
//! **A validator's silence is evidence about the validator, not only about the
//! code**, and that is the rule this crate exists to enforce rather than a
//! remark about one binary. Sixteen deliberate breakages of the writer were run
//! against the suite when it was judged by `fsck_msdos -n`; fourteen went red
//! and the two above did not. A gate whose green means "the judge had nothing
//! to say" is only as strong as the judge, so the judge is ours and its own
//! teeth are gated (`tests/teeth.rs`, a mutation per complaint). Exit codes are
//! not part of it either: `fsck_msdos -n` exits 0 while printing `Fix?` for
//! problems it declined to repair, and exits 0 on a volume it has just declared
//! dirty, so the gate a reader would write first would have been green on a
//! corrupt volume. [`check`] answers with the list instead, and silence is the
//! whole verdict.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let volume: &[u8] = &[];
//! let complaints = toyos_fat32_check::check(volume);
//! assert!(complaints.is_empty(), "{}", toyos_fat32_check::describe(&complaints));
//! ```
//!
//! A [`Complaint`] names what is wrong, where it is, and what the format
//! requires, and carries its numbers as fields rather than baked into a
//! sentence — so two complaints of the same kind about different counts are
//! distinguishable without parsing text.
