//! Whose fault a trap was — the one classification the crash path makes, and
//! the only thing deciding whether a process dies or the machine halts.
//!
//! **The ring is a fact the frame carries, and this file exists so that nothing
//! guesses it from anything else.** The decision used to be spelled
//! `is_user_mode() || (PageFault && current_tid().is_some() && cr2 < USER_TOP)`,
//! and the second disjunct answers *user* for any low faulting address however
//! Ring 0 the frame was. On 2026-08-17 the kernel fetched an instruction from
//! address zero under `sched_stress` —
//! `#PF UNHANDLED: cr2=0x0 rip=0x0 err=0x10 user=false tid=Some(Tid(0))` — the
//! disjunct held on `cr2 = 0` and a live tid, and the kernel went down the
//! *recover* path for a null jump instead of halting on it. The `KERNEL PANIC`
//! and the crash report that would have named the null call were therefore
//! never written, and the shared boot said nothing for the whole 88 s guard.
//! The defect underneath was a `context_switch` restoring a task another CPU
//! was still standing on; the reports this repair unblocked are what named it,
//! four sightings later.
//!
//! [`Ring`] is the repair. It is opaque and its one constructor takes a code
//! segment selector, so a privilege level cannot be read out of a faulting
//! address by any caller: the confusion is unwritable rather than fixed at one
//! call site. What no type can settle is the genuinely ambiguous case that
//! second disjunct existed for — Ring 0 code dereferencing a pointer that
//! crossed the syscall boundary, which must kill the process and not the
//! machine — so [`blame`] answers that one at runtime, from the two addresses
//! the frame carries rather than from one of them.
//!
//! The one thing this names outside itself is the user/kernel bound, and it
//! names it in [`crate::span`] — the same constant `user_ptr.rs` refuses an
//! address above, not a copy of it. That is what makes the two boundary rows in
//! the table below mean anything.
