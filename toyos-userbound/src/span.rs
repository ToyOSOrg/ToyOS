//! The arithmetic every user-memory access rests on: the user/kernel bound, the
//! alignment a type needs, and whether a value the kernel is about to
//! dereference lies inside one mapping.
//!
//! **Three refusals, and each has a way of being wrong the others do not
//! catch.** An address in the kernel half is refused outright. An object whose
//! address is userland's but whose alignment is wrong is refused, because a
//! misaligned read of a wider type reads bytes the caller never proved were
//! mapped. An object that starts inside one 2 MiB page and ends in the next is
//! refused, because only the first page was established — a straddling read
//! takes its tail out of whatever the neighbouring frame happens to hold, and a
//! futex word is dereferenced on every wake check.
//!
//! The bound is also the one [`crate::fault`] classifies a trap against — one
//! constant, read by the check before an access and by the verdict after it.
