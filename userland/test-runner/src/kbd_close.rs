//! A pending poll on stdin outlives the keyboard *claim* being closed.
//!
//! **The defect this is aimed at was cancellation by an object that did not own
//! the source.** `io_uring::cancel_by_source` cancels by source across every ring in
//! the machine — right for a pipe, whose other end really has gone — and
//! `object::ops::close` decided whether to call it by asking the *object*:
//! `Device(_)` answered "this ends its sources", on the argument that a claim
//! admits exactly one handle so every ring watching it is the one holder's.
//! That is true of the claim and false of the source. `Source::Keyboard` is
//! named by the `Device(Keyboard)` claim *and* by every `Console`
//! (`object::ops::read_source`), so the claim's holder closing its handle posted
//! `-NotFound` into every pending `POLL_ADD` on stdin in the machine — libc's
//! terminal read is what arms them — for processes that hold no device and were
//! never consulted.
//!
//! It runs inside `test-runner` because a spawned binary's stdin is a pipe: this
//! process's handle 0 is the `Console`, and the claim it closes is minted from the capability the estate holds. Both objects are in
//! one process, which is the smallest machine the collision exists on; the real
//! failure needs two, and neither has to know about the other.
//!
//! Three arms, and the middle one is why it is not enough to assert that the
//! poll survived:
//!
//! 1. the keyboard claim is taken and released, and the stdin poll must still be
//!    pending — the arm that reds on the defect;
//! 2. the **mouse** claim is polled and released, and *that* poll must be
//!    cancelled — cancellation is exactly what a close there owes. This is the direction a
//!    fix overshoots into: a tree that stopped cancelling on close would pass
//!    arm 1 and red here;
//! 3. an injected keystroke completes the stdin poll — so what survived arm 1
//!    was a live registration and not an absent one.
