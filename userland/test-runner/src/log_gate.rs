//! The conservation law, read through `SYS_LOG_READ` from inside `test-runner`.
//!
//! **It runs here rather than in a binary of its own, and that is capability
//! doctrine rather than convenience.** `test-runner` passes its whole
//! *namespace* to every binary it spawns, and `logread` is not a namespace
//! entry — it is a `SysCap` dup, exactly like `realtime`, which the estate does
//! not hand down either. So the gate that reads the machine's log is the one
//! process in a test image that holds the right from its own manifest row.
//!
//! **The verdict is exact, not statistical.** Every sequence number a shard
//! ever issued is either a record this reader took or one the kernel counted as
//! lost; no number is taken twice; and every storm record's text regenerates
//! byte for byte from the two numbers it declares. A torn record fails the
//! text, a lost record that is not counted fails the ledger, and a duplicated
//! one fails it the other way.
//!
//! **Nothing this reader waits for is a record the ring may drop.** It used to
//! read until every producer had said `logstorm done`, and that record is the
//! last thing one producer writes rather than the last thing written to its
//! shard: two producers placed on one CPU means the second's records lap the
//! first's `done`, and the loop then waited for something that was never
//! coming — twice in seven suites on the dev host, each time the whole 30 s
//! ceiling in the fast tier. So the termination condition is the *cursor*: the
//! log has been drained and nothing new has arrived for [`QUIET_READS`] reads
//! and [`STORM_SETTLE`] of guest time. A `done` is a cross-check where it
//! survived and is never waited on, and the same holds of `logstorm start` and
//! of the nesting burst's own `done`. **The rule this shape exists to keep is
//! general**: a workload whose liveness depends on a record the ring is allowed
//! to drop is the same mistake wherever it appears.
