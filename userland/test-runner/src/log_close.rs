//! A poll on the machine's log outlives a *different* handle to the capability
//! that named it.
//!
//! **The defect this is aimed at was cancellation by source.**
//! `object::ops::close` handed `io_uring::cancel_by_source` whatever sources the
//! closing object named, and `cancel_by_source` walks the source's watcher list across
//! every ring in the machine — which is right for a pipe, whose other end really
//! has gone, and wrong for the log, which outlives every handle that can name
//! it. Every `SysCap` maps to `Source::Log`, so any process closing any
//! capability posted `-NotFound` into every pending log poll there was. Latent
//! while nothing parked on one; live the moment `/system/bin/logd`'s whole loop is
//! read-then-park.
//!
//! The two processes in the real failure need not know about each other at all,
//! which is why this runs with one: a duplicate of this program's own capability
//! is a second handle to the same object, and closing it is exactly the event
//! `cancel_by_source` acted on. What it proves is that the *handle* is not what the
//! source's lifetime is tied to.
//!
//! It runs inside `test-runner` for `log-gate`'s reason — a `SysCap` dup is not
//! a namespace entry, so a spawned binary has none — and it needs `dup` in its
//! manifest row on top of `logread`, which `tests/testcases/system.toml` has.
