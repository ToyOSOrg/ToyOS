//! The audio server: what it claims, what it spawns, and nothing else.
//!
//! **Every decision soundd makes about a sample lives in `toyos-mixer/`** —
//! the i16/f32 conversions, mono and stereo, the gain and its ramp, the sum on
//! the shared bus, the dither and the quantizer, the device shapes a period can
//! be rendered into, the delay-locked loop, and the counters the gate reads.
//! They are pure, they are host-tested, and `toyos-mixer/fixtures/mix-corpus.txt`
//! holds the answer this program used to compute inline, byte for byte. What is
//! left here is the effects: devices, handles, shared memory, timers, threads
//! and the console.
//!
//! The split is `userland/compositor/`'s, against `toyos-desktop/`. Everything
//! under `src/` is one half of soundd's own machinery:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`backend`] | the two devices, and the one thing that differs between them |
//! | [`client`] | one stream: its ring, its ramp, and how it ended |
//! | [`command`] | the ring the control thread hands the mix thread |
//! | [`control`] | the connections, the framing, and what a client may ask for |
//! | [`mix`] | the two loops — a device's, and the null sink's |
//! | [`hda`], [`virtio`] | the two drivers |
//!
//! This file is the fourth thing: which of them the machine gets. A sound card
//! this process was endowed with runs the device loop; anything else — no card,
//! a card that cannot carry audio, a shape the mixer cannot render — runs the
//! null sink, because soundd always runs and always accepts streams.
