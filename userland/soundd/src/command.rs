//! The ring the control thread hands the mix thread.
//!
//! Two threads and one direction: connects, disconnects and volume changes are
//! written by the control thread and drained by the mix thread at the top of
//! every cycle. Nothing travels back — a client's departure reaches the control
//! thread as a dead connection, not as a message.
//!
//! **A server never blocks on a client**, and this ring is where soundd could
//! have. It never drops a command (a ghost client: leaked shm, an app waiting on
//! a stream nothing mixes) and never asserts (soundd dead at a client's
//! choosing); [`submit`] waits instead, throttling the *control* thread, which
//! is the one that can afford it.
