//! One stream: its ring, its ramp, and how it ended.
//!
//! A client is a control connection, a shared-memory ring soundd made for it, a
//! signal pipe soundd kept the write end of, and a gain. This module is where
//! all four are assembled ([`open_stream`]) and where one period of the result
//! reaches the bus ([`mix_client`]).
//!
//! **What the samples then become is `toyos-mixer`'s and not this file's.**
//! [`mix_client`] is the shared memory and the resampler; the decode, the
//! channel conversion, the interleave and the sum are calls into the crate,
//! whose corpus holds the answer each of them used to give inline.
//!
//! The resampler is `rubato`'s, and it is the one thing on this path that
//! nothing here certifies — what is certified is everything on both sides of it.
