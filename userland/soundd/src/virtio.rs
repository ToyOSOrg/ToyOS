//! soundd as the driver of a virtio-sound device.
//!
//! The kernel negotiated the device's features, built its virtqueues and owns
//! their descriptors, and answers one register write per queue doorbell.
//! Everything that is a *decision* is here — which stream, at what rate and
//! format, when a period goes out and when the stream runs — and every one of
//! them is a message this process writes into a buffer of its own and publishes
//! by index.
//!
//! There is no descriptor here and no physical address. The chains were built
//! once, at bind, out of offsets into the region below; what this file writes
//! into an avail ring is which of them to run.
//!
//! Structure layouts and command codes are VirtIO 1.2 §5.14.
