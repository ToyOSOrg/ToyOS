//! The two loops: a device's, and the null sink's.
//!
//! Both are the same body of code with one difference — where a mixed period
//! goes and what clocks the next one. The device loop is clocked by completion
//! records through a delay-locked loop and writes into DMA buffers; the null
//! sink is clocked by a monotonic grid and throws the samples away, so a
//! machine with no audio hardware backpressures its clients at exactly the real
//! rate. Everything else — the command ring, the per-client mix, the ramps,
//! crash detection, the underrun accounting, the idle discipline — is shared.
//!
//! **What a period *is* was decided in `toyos-mixer`** before either loop ran:
//! this file spends the answers and owns the effects around them.
