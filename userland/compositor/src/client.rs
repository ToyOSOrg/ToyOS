//! Everything between a client's pipe and a decision.

//! **The compositor never reads a client with a blocking read**, and never

//! park the caller until the peer sends the bytes it promised, which hands a
//! client the decision of when the desktop runs again; a blocking `send` hands
//! it the same decision by not reading. Here a peer that stops halfway through
//! a frame costs a buffer and a deadline, and one that will not take a message
//! costs itself.
