//! The desktop.
//!
//! Four layers, and the split is the point. `toyos_desktop` decides — where a
//! window goes, what changed since the last frame, what the pointer hit, who
//! has the keyboard, what a key means, what is visible in a damaged region —
//! and every one of those is a pure function with host tests that run in
//! milliseconds. [`session`] does the rest: it claims the devices, drains the
//! client connections without ever blocking on one, allocates and grants the
//! shared
//! buffers, and hands finished rectangles to the panel. [`render`] turns a
//! compose plan into pixels, and [`client`] is the framing and the protocol's
//! failure vocabulary.
//!
//! What is left in this file is the policy the other three read: the numbers
//! that are decisions rather than derivations.
