//! Everything the desktop decides, as pure functions over pure state.
//!
//! Where a window is, what changed since the last frame, what the pointer is
//! over, who has the keyboard, what a key means, what is visible inside a
//! damaged region and which pixels of a client's buffer reach the screen. No
//! I/O, no drawing, no shared memory, no connections — those are the
//! compositor's, and it is the only caller.
//!
//! The split exists because a QEMU boot is a poor way to ask any of these
//! questions. Every decision that can be a pure function is one the host
//! exercises in milliseconds — the arithmetic that decides what a frame costs
//! most of all — and the guest tests are left to certify what only a guest
//! can: that the right pixels reached a panel.
//!
//! A window carries its client as an opaque `C` ([`Window`]), so reordering the
//! stack cannot separate a window's geometry from the connection behind it.
//! Nothing in this crate ever looks at that value.
