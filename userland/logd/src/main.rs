//! `/system/bin/logd` — the machine's log, written to a file by a process that can be
//! killed without taking the kernel with it.
//!
//! What this program replaces is the kernel's own file sink,
//! `kernel/src/log_file.rs`: a kernel module that appended the log ring to a
//! FAT volume **from the idle loop**, which is why an idle CPU on this machine
//! could be found four spinlocks deep inside a USB transfer with a userland
//! `println!` behind it. The kernel keeps the record ring and the console;
//! every policy about files — where they go, what they are called, how many
//! there are, what happens when the stick stops answering — is here.
//!
//! # Its whole authority
//!
//! One `SysCap` duplicate carrying `Rights::LOG | Rights::WAIT`, which its
//! manifest row asks for by the name `logread`. With it, it may read every
//! record every CPU wrote and park on the readiness source when there is
//! nothing new. It claims no device, opens no compositor connection and can
//! name no process. Writing files is ambient — a known residual of the
//! capability endowment, and not this program's to close.
//!
//! # What it does not do, and why the port is not here
//!
//! Its design carries a `log` port with two frame kinds, and **neither has a
//! caller on this tree**:
//!
//! - `Register` carries the read ends of a child's stdout and stderr pipes.
//!   Those pipes do not exist yet — until they do, every program's stdio is a
//!   console object minted at spawn, and nothing sends this frame.
//! - `Sync` was the shutdown path asking for durability. It is **struck**: the
//!   asker is `SYS_SHUTDOWN`, which runs in the *kernel*, and a kernel that
//!   opens an IPC connection to a userland server to ask it a question is the
//!   inversion this architecture exists to avoid. `LogCursor::durable` already
//!   travels the other way on a call this program makes every loop, so the
//!   kernel reads a word instead — shutdown and panic are one mechanism now,
//!   not two.
//!
//! So `serves = ["log"]` is not on its manifest row yet, by the same rule that
//! keeps `logread` off `/system/bin/console`'s: *a right with no caller is a
//! capability handed out for a plan*. The acceptor arrives with the first
//! `Register`.
//!
//! # Durability, which is a contract and not a hope
//!
//! Every batch is written, `fsync`ed and only then published: `LogTail::
//! publish_durable` carries the `at_ns` of the newest record now **on the
//! device**, the kernel clamps it and keeps the maximum in `LOG_DURABLE_NS`,
//! and a panicking kernel waits on that word for its own report to land.
//! Publishing before the sync would make the word a lie in exactly the case it
//! exists for, so the order here is load-bearing: write, sync, publish, never
//! two of the three.
//!
//! `SYS_FSYNC` reaches the device's own cache flush — before it did, it stopped
//! at the page cache, and this program calling the result durable would have
//! been a claim of durability that was not one.
//!
//! **A flush that would block is not a flush that failed**, and since
//! 2026-08-22 this program can tell them apart: `io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`
//! from `sync_all` is `kernel/src/block.rs`'s `BlockError::BudgetExpired`,
//! which means the kernel declined to *start* the operation on the caller's own
//! clock — nothing was issued, the device is untouched, and the bytes are still
//! in the file waiting for the next batch's flush. Keeping the volume across
//! one loses nothing and publishes nothing; ending it on one was a boot's log
//! thrown away for a stick that answered every transfer. `policy::fate` is the
//! whole decision, and `policy`'s own header is the argument.
//!
//! # The console is the kernel's and stays the kernel's
//!
//! This program does **not** write kernel records to the console. `klogd` does,
//! at the commit, and a second copy from here would double every line on the
//! wire. What it writes to its own console is what only it knows: where the log
//! is going, and when it has stopped going there — the kernel keeping the
//! console and giving up the filesystem, taken literally.
