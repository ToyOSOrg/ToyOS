//! The machine's console: `/system/bin/shell` on the raw framebuffer, no compositor.
//!
//! It exists for a machine with no serial port. `--diag-boot` freezes the
//! kernel's boot log on the panel, which answers "how far did it get and what
//! did it say" and nothing else — every further question costs a reflash and a
//! photograph. This program answers questions by being asked them.
//!
//! Three things follow from that and are not incidental:
//!
//! - **It starts with the kernel's log in the scrollback.** Claiming
//!   `DEVICE_FRAMEBUFFER` stops `panic_console::boot_checkpoint` from ever
//!   painting again, so a console that merely cleared the screen would trade
//!   the diagnostic that works today for one that might. The log comes from
//!   `/log/kernel.log`, which is the same bytes: no syscall reads the
//!   kernel's ring and adding one is not this program's call.
//! - **A fatal panic still takes the screen back.** `render` ignores
//!   `SCREEN_OWNED_BY_USERLAND` entirely — only boot checkpoints honour it —
//!   so the report paints over whatever this program drew.
//!   `screen_console_panic` is the gate.
//! - **The emulator is `/system/bin/terminal`'s**, unchanged. `Console::new` always
//!   took a raw mapping; the compositor was never below it. This is the caller
//!   whose mapping is the scanout, so it is the one that pays for a read.
