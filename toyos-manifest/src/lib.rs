//! What every program in an image is allowed to hold, written by the build
//! system and read by `/bin/init`.
//!
//! **One definition of the format, used by both halves.** `src/build.rs`
//! resolves `system.toml` into a [`Manifest`] and [`render`]s it into the
//! ROOT at [`PATH`]; init [`parse`]s it back. A round-trip test here is what
//! makes that a fact rather than two hand-matched implementations — the shape
//! this crate exists to prevent is a renderer and a parser that disagree about
//! one record and a machine that boots with an authority nobody declared.
//!
//! Line-oriented and deliberately not TOML: the build system already has the
//! parsed config, so a TOML parser in the guest would be a dependency for a
