//! `SimHw` — the simulator's side of the [`Hw`] boundary.
//!
//! Real and shared with the kernel: task types, state word, transitions, run
//! queue, fairness math, mailbox, doorbell, sleep handshake, ticket protocol,
//! retire chase, deadlines, pass logic. Mocked here: time, timer, IPI,
//! halt, switch. Nothing above the line is reimplemented, which is the whole
//! point — a simulator that models the scheduler instead of *being* it proves
//! nothing about the code that ships.
