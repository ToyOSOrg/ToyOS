/// **It is a bounded offset, not an accumulating drift**, which is the

/// process, `CpuSched::pick`, the surplus rule in `answer_steal_requests` — is
/// the shipped core; what the simulator mocks is time, timer, IPI, halt and
/// switch. The width scaling follows from one pot per process: every running
/// thread charges the same pot, so it advances at the process's aggregate rate
/// while each queued thread's key stays frozen at its insert, and
/// one dispatch's worth of staleness therefore buys more wall-clock service the

/// * **`solo` has one thread per CPU, `trio` three.** A fair share is per
///   *process*, so they are owed the same CPU. Under any per-thread
///   policy `trio` takes three quarters instead of half — which is the whole
///   distinction, and is `fair_share_per_thread`.
/// * **Thread counts are multiples of `cpus`.** Spawn placement is
///   least-loaded-with-rotation, so each CPU ends up with the identical mix and
///   the run queues are balanced by construction. Balance-by-`StealRequest`
///   only answers a probe from a CPU whose victim has *two* ready tasks, so an
///   odd thread count would leave a standing imbalance and this
///   would be measuring placement rather than fairness.
/// * **Each `solo` thread carries three times a `trio` thread's work**, so the
///   two processes have the *same total* work and, under an even split, finish
///   together. The window I5 measures over closes when the first process stops

///   the *machine* finishing a fixed amount of work and never a split between
///   two claimants — `share_gain` is where that question lives.

///   `threads × work` of CPU delivered by `cpus` CPUs, against the
