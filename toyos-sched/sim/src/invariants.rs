/// section it may have to wait out, plus the granularity of one execution step,
/// **plus one aged corpse's chunk**. Measured in the CPU's *own* busy time, so
/// another CPU's progress cannot inflate it.
///
/// **The fourth term is what bounded deferral costs, and it is priced here
/// rather than declared away.** The cancellable kill introduced the dying
/// list; the first attempt served it *before* `rq` and the term would have
/// been the whole unwind, once per killed task, turning this
/// bound into a statement about how long a kernel teardown takes. The second
/// attempt served it strictly *after* `rq` and had no term at all — at the price
/// of a corpse that never runs under a saturated RT band, which is
/// `scheduler::retire_task`'s tripwire and a kernel panic from a legal
/// `Rights::RT` workload.
///
/// What ships is neither absolute. `CpuSched::pick` takes the dying list ahead
/// of the RT band only once its head has waited
/// [`toyos_sched::cpu::DYING_AGE_NS`], and dispatches it for exactly
/// [`toyos_sched::cpu::DYING_CHUNK_NS`] with `CpuSched::aged_grant` holding the
/// preemption off for that long and no longer. So a ready RT task gives up one
/// chunk, and gives it up **at most once per age window**: the window this
/// bound measures closes the instant the RT task runs, and the corpse's stamp
/// restarts when it is preempted back, so the next aged chunk is a full
/// `DYING_AGE_NS` away. `DYING_AGE_NS`'s own doc carries the inequality that
/// makes that a fact — it has to exceed this bound, and 10 ms against 3.7 ms
/// does.
///
/// **Measured, and conservative rather than load-bearing.** On
/// `scenarios::rt_saturated_retire` seed 0 the aged chunk shows up as exactly
/// one I4 wait of 1,000,000 ns — `DYING_CHUNK_NS` to the nanosecond, read off
/// by forcing this bound to zero and collecting the reported `waited`. The
/// suite would not red without the term, because `2 × RUN_CHUNK_NS` of
/// observation granularity is already wider than the chunk. It is carried

///    `Urgency::Preempt`, and this is how long that delivery may take.
/// 2. `max_kernel_section` — the preempt-off section the target may be inside
///    when the interrupt lands.
/// 3. `QUANTUM_NS` — the pass drains the retire and the victim reaches the
///    dying list, but the pick can only take it once the CPU is free to switch:
///    a *running* fair task keeps the CPU until its quantum expires, which is
///    what bounds this hop.
/// 4. **`(1 + peers) × UNWIND_NS × STRETCH`** — the unwind itself, the unwinds
///    already queued ahead of it on that CPU, and the real-time band's bounded
///    share of the same CPU. See [`rt_deferral_stretch`].
/// 5. `QUANTUM_NS` again — `die` publishes `Dead` and leaves the record as this
///    CPU's *zombie*, because a pass cannot free the stack it is standing on;
///    the payload is released by the **next** pass on that CPU
///    (`SchedPass::begin`), and if that CPU dispatched another task its next
///    pass is that task's quantum expiry. `retire_task`'s own doc states the
///    same hop from the other side, and the wait is for the release, not for
///    the word.
///
/// plus `2 × RUN_CHUNK_NS`, invariant I4's granularity term: the model observes
/// each hop up to one execution chunk late.
///
/// **`peers` is a workload-shaped term**, exactly as invariant I5's
/// `(runnable threads + 1)` factor is. Two corpses on one CPU means the second
/// waits out the first: one CPU cannot run two unwinds at once, and pretending
/// otherwise would price the machine rather than the protocol. `peers` is the
/// greatest number of *other* corpses that CPU has held since this retire was
/// claimed.
///
/// **Where the shape comes from, in the model and in the kernel, and they are
/// not the same.** This model's `Vm::teardown` posts a retire for every sibling
/// of a torn-down process in one op with no wait between them, so a batched
/// single-process teardown is what drives `peers` above zero here. The kernel
/// cannot produce that: both of its teardown loops call `retire_task` per tid
/// and it blocks until the victim is released, so one process teardown holds at
/// most one corpse at a time. What produces `peers > 0` there is *concurrent
/// independent retirers* — separate killer threads retiring separate victims
/// that share a CPU — and nothing bounds how many. The model's shape is the
/// cheaper way to reach the same queue depth, and the bound is about the depth

/// no matter what the scheduler did with the CPU.
///
/// **The window.** Fairness owes nothing across a block: a process with no
/// runnable thread is not being starved, it is waiting. Nor on an unsaturated
/// machine: a CPU with nothing on it is denying nobody. Nor to a process with
/// fewer runnable threads than its even share of the CPUs, which is limited by
/// its own thread count and not by the scheduler. Nor while the RT band is
/// occupied, because the RT band exists to be unfair and invariant I4 is what
/// bounds it. So service is compared over a *contention window* — a maximal
/// interval during which the same set of fair-band processes was continuously
/// runnable, every CPU had a task loaded, every member could absorb its share,
/// and the RT band was empty — and the comparison restarts the moment any of
/// those stops holding. In a workload where everyone blocks the windows are
/// short and this says little; in `fairness_storm`, where nothing blocks and no
/// RT exists, the window is the whole run and it says everything.
///
/// **The bound is derived, and it does not move.** Two terms, both of them a
/// granularity the policy picked:
///
/// * `lag_spread` — the stored lags of the contending shares. A share that
///   parked 50 ms behind the frontier is *entitled* to that much catch-up, so
///   the clamp and the intended service difference are the same number.
///   Asserted against `MAX_VRUNTIME_LAG_NS` here rather than assumed, because
///   the bound is only worth what the clamp is worth.
/// * `(runnable threads + 1) × (QUANTUM + max KernelSection + 2 × RUN_CHUNK)` —
///   the fair band is keyed by the vruntime a task had *when it was inserted*,
///   ties broken by insertion sequence, so a process with T threads carries up
///   to T−1 of its own dispatches' worth of stale keys and can be picked that
///   many times over before its slowest thread comes up. Both sides carry it
///   and the leader is spending one more quantum on top, hence `ΣT_i + 1`.
///   The kernel-section and chunk terms are I9's, for I9's reason: a
///   preempt-off section overruns the quantum it started in, and the model
///   observes the expiry one chunk late.
///
/// Earlier drafts of this check widened that expression twice, because the
/// shipped scheduler brushed it — 74 ms against 72, then 109 ms against 108.
/// Widening was the wrong move and the near-misses were the signal: a bound
/// calibrated to what the code already does cannot detect the code getting
/// worse. The bound is therefore back to the derived form, and where the shipped
/// scheduler does not meet it, that is recorded as a gap rather than absorbed
/// (`scenarios::FAIRNESS_SAMPLE`, which has the measurements and names the four

/// * **One further narrowing of its own: every CPU must carry the same number
///   of each member's runnable threads.** Two siblings on differently composed
///   CPUs are limited by where they were placed, and the policy makes no
///   per-thread placement promise to hold them to; I13's window re-baselines
///   the instant that stops holding, so it is a sub-interval of I5's rather
///   than a second notion of contention. This is not a hypothetical: at two
///   CPUs the shipped scheduler separates two `trio` threads by 49 ms with one
///   of them sharing a CPU with a `solo` thread that is catching up — I5's
///   entitlement being honoured, not a sibling being cheated.
/// * The measured set is fixed when the window opens and only ever shrinks. A
///   thread that blocks or exits mid-window is owed nothing further and leaves
///   the comparison — it does not close the window, because the siblings still
///   runnable are still owed an even split.
/// * A window with a *single* member is still measured, which is the one
///   relaxation. I5 needs two processes before it has a spread at all; one
///   process with two threads is already a comparison.
///
/// **The bound is derived, and it does not move.** It is I5's bound with the
/// lag term deleted, and the deletion is the whole content of it:
///
/// * `(ΣT_i + 1) × (QUANTUM + max KernelSection + 2 × RUN_CHUNK)` — I5's own
///   staleness term, unchanged and computed from the same running maximum. The
///   fair band is keyed by the vruntime a thread held when it was *inserted*,
///   and a dispatched thread is re-inserted with its share's pot as it stands
///   after the charge — strictly above the key it was holding. So every other
///   ready thread in the window, sibling or not, can be picked at most once
///   ahead of a waiting thread on the strength of a key that was already stale
///   when the wait began, and the leader spends one more dispatch on top. It is
///   `ΣT_i` and not the share's own thread count because a thread waits behind
///   the *whole* fair band on its CPU: an earlier draft of this check counted
///   only siblings, which is a derivation that assumes the rest of the machine
///   away, and the shipped scheduler crossed it at every width above one. The
///   running maximum is I13's own (`thread_threads`) because I13's window is
///   the shorter of the two.
/// * **No lag term.** I5 carries `lag_spread` because two different shares may
///   hold stored lags up to ±[`MAX_VRUNTIME_LAG_NS`] apart and are entitled to
///   that much catch-up. [`toyos_sched::fair::ShareState`] holds one vruntime
///   and one lag for every thread of a process, so the intra-share lag spread
///   is identically zero — there is no per-thread entitlement to be behind.
///   That absence is exactly why a per-share check can be tighter than I5, and
///   why it can see what I5 cannot.
///
/// **What it does not cover is placement.** The insertion-order argument is
/// about one run queue, and two threads of one share on differently loaded CPUs
/// sit in two of them; nothing in the policy equalizes those, and a check that
/// asserted it would be measuring the workload. `scenarios::fairness_storm`
/// hands every CPU the identical mix by construction (its own doc says why),
/// which is what makes the number reported there a statement about the
/// ordering.
///
/// **What reds a run** is `max(derived bound, recorded allowance)`, and
