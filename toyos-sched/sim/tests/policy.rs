//! **The measured policy suite**: what the scheduler's policy actually delivers,
//! as numbers, against bounds derived from its own constants.
//!
//! `scenarios.rs` next door is the exit criterion — every negative gate fails,
//! every scenario passes. That is a suite of *verdicts*, and the external review
//! of 2026-08-20 named what it leaves out: the policy this scheduler states —
//! "threads execute, processes own fair share" — is encoded in implementation
//! intent and was validated nowhere empirically. A verdict cannot say how much
//! share a process actually got, how long an interactive wake actually waited,
//! or how long a runnable task can actually be passed over. Those are the
//! quantities a user feels, and each one below is measured and then asserted.
//!
//! # The one constant every bound here is made of
//!
//! Every case in this file lands on the same term, and it is not a coincidence:
//!
//! ```text
//! (runnable threads on one CPU + 1) × (QUANTUM_NS + max KernelSection + 2 × RUN_CHUNK_NS)
//! ```
//!
//! The fair band is keyed by the vruntime a thread held **when it was inserted**
//! (`queue.rs`), and a share's pot advances only when one of its
//! threads runs. So a thread queued behind `R` others can be passed over by all
//! `R` of them on the strength of keys that were already stale when its own wait
//! began, and the leader spends one more quantum on top. It is invariant I5's
//! staleness term and invariant I13's whole bound, and this file is the finding
//! that it is *also* the interactive wake latency, *also* the starvation bound,
//! and *also* exactly what a thread-count attack is worth. The kernel-section
//! and chunk terms are I9's, for I9's reason: a preempt-off section overruns the
//! quantum it started in, and the model observes an expiry one chunk late.
//!
//! # What each case measures, and what it found
//!
//! | case | measured | derived bound | measured/bound |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | thread-count asymmetry | `solo` finishes `N+1` quanta late, at every `N` | `(N+2) × 12 ms` | 0.82 at N=64 |
//! | the deficit over time | 50 ms at N=4, 170 ms at N=16, unchanged as the window doubles twice | an offset, not a drift | — |
//! | interactive wake | 637 ms worst at 64 hogs; every wake but one at 0 ns | `(rivals+1) × 12 ms` = 792 ms | 0.80 |
//! | wakeup storm drain | 27.75 ms for 64 waiters on one CPU, 3.1× the 16-waiter figure | `(per queue+1) × 12 ms` = 780 ms | 0.04 |
//! | starvation | 70 ms at 5 runnable threads, 680 ms at 65 | `(threads+1) × 12 ms` | 0.97 / 0.86 |
//! | adversarial placement | a CPU an adversary loaded is drained to the surplus floor, and only the CPUs still awake are reached | `threads − 2` stealable | 1.00 |
//! | a bounded re-arm | every CPU is reached at every width; 10 ms of probe gap | `every_ns + 3 × RUN_CHUNK` = 13 ms | 0.77 |
//! | a push on surplus | every CPU is reached at every width; 66 ms of probe gap at eight | `(cpus−1) × 12 ms + IPI + 2 × RUN_CHUNK` | 0.77 |
//! | what the cures cost | 0 idle wakes/s shipped, 154/s for the cheapest re-arm and **0/s** for the push on `audio_pipeline` | wake latency unchanged, under its own bound | — |
//!
//! The adversarial-placement case is the only one whose bound is a *count*
//! rather than a duration, and that is the model's limit rather than a choice:
//! the clock advances on the executing CPU's step, so a run's makespan is what
//! one CPU would take at every width and no wall-clock statement about a wide
//! machine can be read off it. What survives is the protocol — how many tasks
//! the balance path moved, and which CPUs ever got one — and that is enough to
//! separate a machine that recovers from one that does not. The two cure cases
//! below it inherit the same limit and answer it the same way: recovery is
//! counted in CPUs, and timed in **probe gaps** — how long a halted CPU sat
//! beside a published surplus with no probe of its own outstanding, which is a
//! quantity the protocol owns end to end.
//!
//! Every number came from this file at 16–40 seeds per point:
//! `cargo test -p toyos-sched-sim --test policy -- --nocapture`. The tables in
//! each test carry the full sweeps.
//!
//! # What the numbers say, in one paragraph
//!
//! **A process cannot buy CPU by forking, and the qualifier is a window
//! length.** `swarm` with N threads delays a single-threaded rival by exactly
//! `N+1` quanta — once — and never again however long the run goes on. Over the
//! 120 ms `solo` would take against one rival that is a fall from a 500‰ share
//! to 77‰ at N=64; over a window four times as long the same deficit is 453‰ at
//! N=4. So the policy's claim holds asymptotically and is a granularity
//! statement, not a guarantee about any particular window — which is the honest
//! form of "processes own fair share", and it is measured here rather than
//! asserted anywhere.
//!
//! **The pull half is one-shot, and the shipped push is what closes it.** An
//! idle CPU posts one probe on its way to `hlt` and nothing re-posts it, so
//! under plain `Balance::Pull` a CPU that halted before any neighbour published
//! surplus was never probed again: 0 of 20 seeds reach every CPU at eight. A
//! bounded re-arm of the probe and a push on surplus each take that to 20 of 20
//! at every width, and they cost opposite things — the timer ticks whether or
//! not there is anything to come for, the push fires only where there is. On
//! the audio pipeline that is 154 extra idle wakes per second against **zero**,
//! which is why `Balance::PushOnSurplus` ships (owner decision 2026-08-23) and
//! the re-arm was declined; these three cases are the numbers the decision was
//! made on.
//!
//! # Determinism, seeds, and what varies
//!
//! The simulator is deterministic in its decision stream: a seed is a schedule.
//! Every case sweeps seeds 0..N alternating the uniform driver with PCT, which is
//! the idiom `scenarios.rs` uses and the only source of variation the tree has —
//! there is no wall clock and no host randomness anywhere in a run. Two of the
//! workloads sit at one CPU, where the enabled-step set is nearly a singleton and
//! every seed produces the *same* run: `share_gain`'s worst and best across 16
//! seeds are the identical nanosecond at every width, and that is reported rather
//! than hidden, because a worst-of-N over N identical runs is a worst-of-one and
//! a reader is owed that. The multi-CPU cases do vary, and there the sweep is
//! doing what a sweep is for.

/// beside a published surplus with no probe outstanding for longer than
/// `every_ns + 3 × RUN_CHUNK` — [`Outcome::probe_gap_ns`] is that quantity, and
