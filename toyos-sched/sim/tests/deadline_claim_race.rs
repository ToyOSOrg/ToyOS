//! A wake claimed between a pass's mailbox drain and its deadline fire.
//!
//! `SchedPass::begin` runs `drain` and `fire_deadlines` back to back with no
//! step boundary between them, so the explorer cannot place a remote claim
//! there: `fire_deadlines`' `Claim::Lost` arm is unreachable in every scenario
//! the simulator can generate. On hardware the window is two instructions of a
//! remote CPU — `TaskShared::claim_wake` and the `Msg::Wake` post that follows
//! it in `waitq::deliver_wake` — and this test is that pair with a whole pass
//! executed in between, which is the only way to say it.
//!
//! What it asserts is invariant T across that window: a CPU that
//! holds a parked task with a pending deadline has its timer armed for it. The
//! state it constructs is the one `kernel/src/sched/dump.rs` cannot describe —
//! a machine halted with a parked thread and a stopped timer reports
//! `1 pending, 0 OVERDUE`, which is what health looks like.
//!
//! It fails by aborting, like `scenarios::old_preemptible_window`: a task and
//! a wait registration are linear values with drop bombs, so unwinding out of
//! a failed assertion sets them off. The first line printed is the verdict.
