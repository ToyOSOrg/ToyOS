//! The scheduler harness's exit criterion, and the register of what proves it
//! has teeth.
//!
//! The criterion is two claims, and the second is worth nothing without the
//! first:
//!
//! 1. **Every negative gate fails**, and fails for the *right* reason. A
//!    harness that has never rejected the bug class it was written for is
//!    decoration.
//! 2. **Every scenario passes**, over a seed sweep and a fuzz-byte sweep.
//!
//! # The ten negative gates, and the two controls
//!
//! Each is a `scenarios::` constructor that *is* a broken scheduler, and each
//! has a `#[test]` below asserting both that it is caught and which invariant
//! catches it. That second column is the point: a gate caught by the wrong
//! check says nothing about the one it was written for.
//!
//! | gate | breaks | caught by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `old_steal_port` | the old steal-and-scan algorithm | I1 **and** I8 |
//! | `old_commit_before_pass` | the pre-`8508b37` blocking shape | I1, on every seed |
//! | `old_preemptible_window` | preemption left on in the registration window | an abort inside `check_cpu` |
//! | `old_migrate_kept_the_corpse` | the balance path handing on a killed task | I14 |
//! | `old_rt_starved_the_corpse` | the RT band outranking the dying list without a bound | I14, on every seed |
//! | `old_park_kept_the_lend` | commit `9c2fc4d`'s park keeping a lapsed lend | I9 |
//! | `fair_share_per_thread` | one fair share per thread, not per process | I5, and nothing else |
//! | `fair_double_charge` | a share charged twice for what it runs | I5, in the opposite direction |
//! | `fair_identity_within_share` | the lowest-keyed sibling served, not the earliest-inserted | I13, and nothing else |
//! | `overlong_pass` | a pass costing five times its budget | `cpu::PassCosts`, which records it rather than aborting |
//!
//! The controls are `old_commit_fused` and `fair_identity_tiebreak`, and both
//! must come back **clean**. They are what make two of those gates measurements
//! rather than guesses about which break was needed: the first is the same
//! blocking bug with no step boundary to expose it, which is the blind spot
//! this harness used to have; the second is the tie-break `queue.rs` warns
//! about, ported literally and invisible to I13 — which is why the gate beside
//! it had to be the stronger `fair_identity_within_share`.
//!
//! # The liveness gates, which are a different claim
//!
//! Three checks below are not negative gates. They guard against a gate that
//! goes *quiet* rather than red — a change that narrows the gate's own coverage
//! instead of violating it — by asserting that an invariant had a comparison
//! open for a recorded fraction of the run:
//! `the_fairness_storm_is_measured_and_holds` for I5,
//! `invariant_i13_is_measured_and_holds` for I13, and
//! `a_retire_completes_inside_its_derived_bound` for I14, which requires some
//! retire to have outlived the instant it was posted in. A change that closes
//! those windows is then as loud as one that violates them.
//!
//! # Running it
//!
//! The budgets here are what a `cargo test` can afford. The full criterion —
//! 10⁴ seeds and 10⁷ fuzz steps per scenario class — runs from the CLI, where
//! `gate` carries all ten gates and both controls:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release -p toyos-sched-sim -- gate 10000
//! cargo run --release -p toyos-sched-sim -- fuzz-sweep 10000000
//! ```
//!
//! The on-target half is `sched_check_build` (`tests/toyos.rs`), which boots a
//! kernel carrying the same `feature = "check"` asserts. `overlong_pass` proves
//! the pass budget's assert compiles and fires against a *modelled* cost; only
//! a booted kernel reads a TSC.
