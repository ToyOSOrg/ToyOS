//! Loom harness for the `toyos-sched` primitives.
//!
//! This crate is `toyos-sched` compiled a second time: the module list below
//! includes the very same source files, with `feature = "loom"` on, so
//! `crate::sync` resolves to loom's instrumented atomics and `Arc`. The
//! models live in `tests/`; loom explores the interleavings of the *real*
//! primitives, not of a re-implementation — a re-implementation is exactly
//! the divergence risk this crate is meant to remove.
//!
//! Division of labour, stated honestly: loom owns the primitives the
//! simulator's step granularity assumes correct — mailbox push/drain, doorbell
//! edges, the ticket CAS protocol, kill-bit vs wake ordering, retire-node
//! re-post, the sleep handshake. The simulator owns the protocol above them.
//! Loom does not scale to the whole scheduler; the simulator does not model
//! weak memory.
//!
//! Keep this module list identical to `../src/lib.rs`. `fair` is pure math
//! with no atomics worth modelling beyond the frontier's `fetch_max`, but it
//! is compiled all the same: `cpu.rs` calls it, and a divergent module list
//! would mean loom checking a different crate than the one that ships.
