//! Loom: the sleep handshake and the doorbell's kick accounting
//! (invariant I2).
//!
//! The handshake is: publish SLEEPING, drain, check the mailbox one last
//! time, then halt. A producer that posts after that check raises the KICK
//! edge with SLEEPING already visible, so it sends the targeted IPI and the
//! halt cannot be a sleep-through. The IPI is modelled as a counter, because
//! its only relevant effect is "the target cannot stay halted".
//!
//! Two producers, so the edge-coalescing rule (a normal wake to a busy CPU
//! costs zero IPIs; a sleeping CPU always gets one) is exercised rather than
//! assumed.
//!
//! The edge the property rests on is `ring`'s read of the doorbell's bits: it
//! is what lets a producer see a target's freshly published SLEEPING before
//! deciding to elide the IPI. On x86 every read-modify-write is a full fence,
//! so a build with it relaxed behaves identically to this one and no guest
//! test can fail here. The negative case is a cargo feature rather than a
//! comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p toyos-sched-loom --features doorbell-kick-relaxed \
//!   --test loom_sleep
//! ```
//!
//! makes that read relaxed and this file must red, at
//! [`a_halted_cpu_with_queued_work_was_kicked`], whose assertion names the
//! failure exactly: halted with messages still queued and no IPI in flight.
