//! Loom: the intrusive MPSC under torn pushes.
//!
//! One model, two configurations. The threads are the three producers a CPU
//! actually has — its own thread context, its own IRQ context, and another
//! CPU — plus the scheduler pass that IRQ exit may run:
//!
//! * `local`  — CPU0 thread context, pushing to CPU0's own mailbox under a
//!   [`PreemptModel`] guard (the mandatory preempt-disabled push).
//! * `irq`    — CPU0 IRQ context: pushes (interrupting `local`'s push in some
//!   interleavings), then at IRQ exit runs a pass *if* preemption
//!   is enabled.
//! * `remote` — another CPU: pushes and rings with `Urgency::Normal`, so a
//!   busy target gets no IPI — its message is the one
//!   that ends up behind the unlinked suffix.
//!
//! Two properties are checked.
//!
//! **Delivery (both configurations).** No message is ever lost: a torn push
//! delays the suffix by the pusher's remaining instructions and the following
//! doorbell edge brings the consumer back. The terminal assertion after every
//! producer has joined is that one pass drains all three messages and every
//! embedded node is free again.
//!
//! **I2 (the reason the guard is mandatory).** A CPU must not halt while its
//! own interrupted context is inside a push. That context cannot resume while
//! its CPU is halted, so the suffix behind its unlinked node — every message
//! other CPUs pushed after it, whose doorbell edges this pass just consumed —
//! is stranded with nothing left to raise an edge. Preempt-disable is exactly
//! what makes the state unreachable: the IRQ-exit pass and a preempt-disabled
//! push exclude each other, so the pass never observes a half-linked local
//! push. `PreemptModel::disable` models that exclusion, and
//! `--features no-preempt-guard` models it away — at which point loom finds
//! the forbidden interleaving, which is what
//! `preempted_producer_strands_suffix` asserts.
