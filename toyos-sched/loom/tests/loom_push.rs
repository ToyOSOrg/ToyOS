//! Loom: the publish/observe edge `Balance::PushOnSurplus` is made of.
//!
//! The pull half of the balance path needs no ordering between two CPUs at all:
//! an idle CPU reads a surplus, and if it reads a stale one it simply does not
//! probe. The push half is different in kind, because it is a *liveness* claim
//! that rests on one CPU observing another — the CPU that gained surplus reads
//! the SLEEPING bit of the CPU that is going to sleep, and decides from it
//! whether anybody needs telling.
//!
//! That makes it the store-buffer litmus test:
//!
//! ```text
//! pusher                             sleeper
//! ------                             -------
//! surplus.store(2)                   doorbell.fetch_or(SLEEPING)
//! balance_fence()                    balance_fence()
//! doorbell.load()   -> asleep?       surplus.load()   -> anything to steal?
//! ```
//!
//! Each side stores to one location and loads the other, and with anything
//! weaker than a `SeqCst` fence between the two, **both loads may miss**: the
//! pusher decides nobody is asleep, the sleeper decides there is nothing to come
//! for, and the machine is back at the pull path's one-shot defect — a CPU
//! asleep beside a published surplus that nothing will ever probe —
//! in a window nanoseconds wide instead of milliseconds. Nothing in a guest test
//! can find that — on x86 the sleeper's side of it is a `lock or`, a full fence
//! already, so only the pusher's half is even reorderable and only under a
//! store-buffer delay no test can schedule.
//!
//! The property below is the one the push actually needs: **a CPU that halts
//! without having seen the surplus has a poke coming.** It is the same shape as
//! `loom_sleep.rs`'s I2 — halted with work queued implies an IPI in flight —
//! asked of the push's own pair rather than of the mailbox's.
//!
//! The negative control is a cargo feature rather than a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p toyos-sched-loom --features push-fence-relaxed --test loom_push
//! ```
//!
//! makes `cpu::balance_fence` a release fence — which orders stores against
//! stores and nothing against a later load — and this file must red at
//! [`a_cpu_that_halts_without_seeing_the_surplus_was_pushed`]. Verified
//! 2026-08-22, both ways round.
