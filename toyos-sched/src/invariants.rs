//! The checks that run *inside* the core: the cheap subset a kernel pass can
//! afford at its end.
//!
//! Everything here is local to one CPU, because that is all a pass can see
//! without reaching into another CPU's state — which is exactly what the
//! design forbids. The global walks (I1 single ownership across every
//! container and message, I8 payload refcounts, I7 accounting conservation)
//! belong to the simulator, which is the only world that can hold all CPUs at
//! once; [`residents`] is what it walks this CPU with.
//!
//! `feature = "check"` gates the call in `SchedPass::finish`, not this module:
//! the simulator wants the enumeration unconditionally, and a check that is
//! compiled but never called costs nothing.
