//! The one wait/wake primitive.
//!
//! Every waitable kernel object (pipe end, futex bucket, listener, io_uring
//! CQ, driver queue) owns a [`WaitQueue`]. Every blocking site uses the same
//! two-phase commit, and **every** wake in the system — remote waker, local
//! deadline fire, join, device ISR tail — terminates in the single claim CAS
//! of [`crate::task::TaskShared::claim_wake`]. There is no second path.
//!
//! The shape a blocking site must have:
//!
//! ```text
//! loop {
//!     if let Some(n) = pipe.try_read(buf) { return n; }
//!     let t = pipe.readers.prepare_wait(&cur);
//!     if pipe.has_data() { t.cancel(); continue; }   // closes the TOCTOU
//!     match block_on(t, deadline) { Woken | Timeout => continue }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Two structural choices, both to keep `unsafe` confined to `mailbox.rs`. The
//! queue's list is behind a [`LeafLock`] the *environment* supplies (kernel: an
//! IRQ-off leaf lock; loom: a `loom::sync::Mutex`) rather than a lock
//! implemented here. And waiters are held as `Arc<TaskShared>` in a `VecDeque`
//! rather than through an embedded `wait_node` link; `TaskShared.waiting` still
//! enforces one queue per task, but the allocation-free intrusive list is still
//! owed.
