//! The per-CPU machine.
//!
//! A CPU's scheduler state is a `!Sync` value reachable only through that
//! CPU's own pointer; there is no global runqueue array, because a `static` of
//! a `!Sync` type does not compile. Everything a remote CPU can do is post a
//! message into [`CpuHandle`] and ring its doorbell.
//!
//! Every entry is a [`SchedPass`]: a type-state that must be disposed exactly
//! once and can only end in [`SchedPass::finish`], which returns an [`Action`]
//! the driver executes. When the action is returned every borrow of `CpuSched`
//! has ended, so no guard can leak across the context switch and nothing
//! scheduler-related has anywhere to run after the switch resumes.
//!
//! **The corollary is that the pass ends before the switch begins**, and it is
//! load-bearing rather than incidental: while a pass runs, and for as long
//! afterwards as the driver takes to reach `Hw::switch`, the outgoing task's
//! saved context still holds whatever the *previous* switch away from it left
//! there. A pass may therefore decide anything it likes about that task except
//! to let another CPU restore it ([`SchedPass::answer_steal_requests`]).

/// observes and what no workload scales, so the cost of a pass is recorded as a
/// distribution ([`PassCosts`]) and judged where composed quantities are judged:
/// in the harness and the simulator.
///
/// **The harness's line is not this number, and a measurement is why.** Host

/// * The dying list ahead of `rq` starved a ready real-time task for the whole

///   revocation, so a killed thread of an RT process on that CPU never reaches
///   `Hw::release`, and `scheduler::retire_task`'s tripwire panics the kernel

/// The arms this file has that nothing else covers.

/// Every arm exercised below — the retire's three, the pick's, the balance
/// path's and the adopt's — is otherwise reachable only through the simulator,
/// which explores *scenarios* rather than stating what a single arm does. These
/// are the statements a reader can check one at a time.
///
/// The harness is deliberately the smallest thing that can hold a `CpuSched`:
/// a payload with no address space, an `Hw` that records rather than acts, and
/// one CPU unless a test needs two.
///
/// **A world holding one task cannot state where a disposition put it.** The
/// pick launders every container back into `running`, so "it ended up running"
/// is what a fair-queue route, a dying-list route and a no-op all produce, so a
/// gate written that way is vacuous unless it reds under a mutation. A *second*
/// occupant — a task
/// already in the dying list, or an RT task already in the band — is what makes
/// the answer observable, because the pick then takes that one and leaves the
/// one under test where the disposition put it. Every test below that asserts a
/// container says which second occupant it needs and why.
