//! Atomics and `Arc`, resolved to whichever world compiles these sources:
//! `core`/`alloc` for the kernel and the simulator, loom's instrumented
//! atomics for the `toyos-sched-loom` package.
//!
//! A feature and a second package rather than the usual `--cfg loom`, because
//! a `[target.'cfg(loom)'.dependencies]` entry lands in every lockfile that
//! resolves this crate — including `kernel/Cargo.lock`, which would gain loom
//! and its 30 transitive host crates. `loom` is declared here purely so `cfg`
//! checking knows the name; this package never enables it.
