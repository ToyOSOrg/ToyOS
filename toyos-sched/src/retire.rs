//! The retire protocol: a sticky kill bit plus a message chase.
//!
//! **Termination argument.** The kill bit is already set when the message is
//! posted, so whichever CPU ends up owning the task *schedules* it — into that
//! CPU's dying list, or by asking a running victim for a safe point — and it
//! dies by its own `die` at the first safe point its own unwind reaches. The
//! chase is bounded by the number of in-flight hops (≤1 in practice). Nothing
//! scans; the home CPU in the state word is the proof.
