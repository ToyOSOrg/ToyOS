//! Intrusive MPSC mailbox and doorbell.
//!
//! One queue per CPU. Producers are any CPU or IRQ context; the consumer is
//! the owning CPU, at pass start. Nodes are **embedded in the objects the
//! messages are about** (`TaskShared.wake_node`, `TaskShared.retire_node`,
//! the task record's adopt node, the per-CPU steal probe) and never
//! allocated, so there is no capacity to size wrong: **queue overflow has no
//! representation**, and an ownership-carrying message cannot be dropped
//! because the message *is* the owner.
//!
//! This is the only module in the crate allowed to write `unsafe`. Everything
//! it does rests on three invariants, each restated at its use site:
//!
//! * **N1 (single claim).** A node carries at most one message at a time —
//!   [`MailboxNode::claim`] is the only way to post and it hands out an
//!   exclusive [`PostSlot`] until the consumer has fully unlinked the node.
//!   This is invariant I12, enforced here rather than argued at the call
//!   sites.
//! * **N2 (liveness).** A node's owner outlives the message: the kernel's
//!   nodes live in the `Arc<TaskShared>` / boxed task record the message is
//!   about, and the retire protocol keeps them alive until the home CPU has
//!   consumed the message. Dropping a node while a message from it is queued
//!   is caught by [`MailboxNode`]'s drop bomb, before the memory is released.
//! * **N3 (preempt-disabled push).** Every producer pushes inside a
//!   preempt-disabled region: [`MailboxProducer::post`] demands a
//!   [`PreemptGuard`], so a caller *cannot* type an unguarded push. See the
//!   torn-push discussion on [`MailboxProducer::post`].
