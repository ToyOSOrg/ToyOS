//! The timer plan: the one armed instant a CPU carries.
//!
//! A deadline lives in exactly one place: the `ParkedEntry` of the task that
//! owns it, on that task's home CPU. Only *ready* tasks migrate, so a deadline
//! can never end up on a CPU that no longer owns its task, and a task that is
//! not parked structurally cannot have one.
//!
//! There is no separate index, and the absence is the design: an ordered index
//! would hold the deadline a second time, and the pass that ended a park would
//! have to remember to retire both. It did not — `fire_deadlines` discarded the
//! index entry of a claim it lost and left the entry's copy standing, which is
//! a CPU reporting a deadline nothing will fire.
//!
//! **Not every arming is a deadline.** [`TimerPlan::no_later_than`] lets a caller
//! pull the arming forward for a reason nothing in this module knows about — a
//! CPU that wants waking to look for work again. It moves the instant in one
//! direction only, which is what keeps invariant T out of it: the invariant
//! bounds the armed instant from above by the earliest event the CPU owes, so
//! an extra wake before that instant is a spurious pass and never a missed
//! deadline.
