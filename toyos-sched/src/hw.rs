//! The hardware boundary: everything the scheduler core needs from the
//! world, in three traits stacked by what they have to know about.
//! [`Kicker`] knows only a CPU id; [`Machine`] adds the rest of the
//! task-blind surface (clock, one-shot timer, interrupt gate, halt, trace);
//! [`Hw`] adds the two operations that carry a task — the context switch and
//! the finalize sink. The kernel implements them with LAPIC one-shot,
//! targeted x2APIC ICR, TSC and the asm switch; the simulator over a virtual
//! clock and vcpu bookkeeping. No scheduling decision, state transition or
//! ordering-sensitive code may live behind them.
