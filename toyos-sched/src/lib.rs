//! ToyOS scheduler core — a sans-IO state machine driven by both the kernel and
//! the host simulator through one [`hw::Hw`] boundary. Nothing here reads a
//! clock, sends an IPI or touches a register: every effect is a value the caller
//! is handed and has to perform, which is what lets the same sources run under a
//! simulator and under loom.
//!
//! Two host-side harnesses compile against these same sources: the simulator
//! (`toyos-sched/sim/`), which explores the protocol against invariants
//! I1–I13, and the `toyos-sched-loom` package (`toyos-sched/loom/`), which
//! swaps in loom's instrumented atomics — see [`sync`] for why loom is a
//! separate package rather than a `cfg(loom)` dependency.
