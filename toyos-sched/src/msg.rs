//! The cross-CPU message set — these four and no others.
//!
//! Two of the four messages are requests about a task the target already
//! owns; one *is* the ownership transfer. That is the property that makes
//! overflow unrepresentable: a queue that cannot drop a message cannot
//! lose a task, because the message is the task.
//!
//! Its own module rather than part of `mailbox.rs`, so that the crate's single
//! `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` island stays exactly the intrusive-list code.
