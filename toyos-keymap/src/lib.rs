//! Keyboard layouts and dead-key composition.
//!
//! A layout maps a HID usage and a modifier level to one of three things: a
//! string, a dead key, or nothing. [`Composer`] turns that stream into the
//! bytes a key press delivers, holding a pending diacritic between two
//! presses, and [`Translator`] is the whole of what a surface owner does with
//! a transition — layout, composition, control codes and escape sequences.
//!
//! Userland only. The kernel delivers the transition and nothing else, so
//! nothing here needs a kernel: the tables are data and the composition is a
//! two-state machine over them, which is what makes this testable on the host
//! at millisecond cost.
