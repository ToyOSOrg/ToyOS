//! `tests/testcases/pp_tcc/` — 25 preprocessor cases with `.expect` files,
//! committed and attributed since 2026-08-08 and read by nothing until now.
//!
//! Three things about the protocol, because four of the twenty-five verdicts
//! move if any of them is got wrong.
//!
//! **The compared stream is the output and the diagnostics together.** `16`'s
//! entire expected output is a warning; a driver that reads stdout alone reds
//! it for ever and for no defect. That is why this drives the *binary* rather
//! than the library: the diagnostics are `eprintln!` on the process's own
//! stderr, and capturing those in-process needs a file descriptor the library
//! does not offer.
//!
//! **The source is named as its `.expect` names it.** `23.expect` contains
//! `40 "23.S"`, so `__FILE__` has to be the bare basename, which means running
//! from inside the corpus directory.
//!
//! **The normalisation is written down here rather than delegated to a tool.**
//! tcc's own harness pipes through `diff -bB`, and what that means differs
//! between implementations: this host's BSD `diff` reports a moved blank line
//! as a change where GNU diffutils would not, and GNU is not installed here so
//! the two cannot be compared. The rule below is what the verdicts were
//! taken under and it decides `05`, `16` and `24` by itself.
