//! The preprocessor's fatal errors, as seen by a caller.
//!
//! `toyos-cc/src` panics — 98 sites and no `-> Result` — and a caller that
//! wants to survive a bad translation unit catches the unwind. Three of these
//! errors called `process::exit` instead, which no caller can catch: the
//! harness compiles 156 files in one process and the first `#include
//! <stdatomic.h>` took the whole run down with no verdict.
