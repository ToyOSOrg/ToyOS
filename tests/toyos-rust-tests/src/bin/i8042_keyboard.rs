//! Claims the keyboard and prints what arrives, one line per event.

//! Driven by eight host tests that boot a guest with no USB HID at all and
//! inject through QMP once the ready line appears. Not a standalone test: on
//! its own it would time out with nothing to report, which is why it is in
//! RUST_SKIP.
//!
//! It holds a [`Translator`] because the kernel no longer does: the claim carries
//! a HID usage and a modifier mask, and what those type is a layout, which is
//! userland's. This is the same type and the same call `/system/bin/console` and
//! every window client make, so `tr=` below is what a real surface would put
//! on a real shell's stdin.
