//! netd's piped-connection cap, from the client side.
//!
//! Needs netd with a NIC in front of it, which only `tests/netcase` provides —
//! it is in `RUST_SKIP` and `netd_connection_caps` runs it there.
//!
//! Every request goes to a destination that cannot answer, so each one netd
//! accepts stays in `pending_piped_connects` for the whole burst. That is
//! deliberate: the cap counts pending connects alongside established ones, so
//! a burst of connects is the shortest path to the boundary, and it needs no
//! peer at all. The requests are issued without reading any reply — `NetdConn`
//! splits send from receive — because reading would block on a connect that is
//! working exactly as intended.
//!
//! The argument is the burst size, not the answer. The host passes the cap
//! netd announced so this does not have to guess how many requests are enough;
//! where the boundary actually falls is measured here and compared there.
