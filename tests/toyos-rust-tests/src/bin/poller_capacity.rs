//! A `Poller` cannot lose a completion inside the capacity it declared.
//!
//! `Poller::new(handles)` used to round the request up and *clamp* it, and
//! `watch_raw` used to flush a full submission ring mid-registration. Those
//! two together are the loss: the flush makes the kernel process registrations
//! while the caller is still registering, so handles that are already ready post
//! completions into a ring sized for a set the caller never actually declared.
//! Past `cq_size` the kernel increments `dropped` and returns, and the caller
//! blocks forever on readiness that was thrown away.
//!
//! The capacity is now a contract. Three directions, because a bound that
//! refuses everything passes the two negative cases on its own:
//!
//! 1. a poller at exactly its capacity delivers every completion;
//! 2. declaring a capacity the kernel cannot build is refused, not clamped;
//! 3. registering past the declared capacity is refused, not flushed.
