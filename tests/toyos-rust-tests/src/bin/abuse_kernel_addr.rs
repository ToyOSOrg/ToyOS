//! Two syscalls take an address from userland and hand it to
//! `AddressSpace::translate`, which walked any PML4 index. A user address space
//! shallow-copies the kernel's PML4 half, so a kernel address resolved to a
//! present, writable 2 MiB leaf of the direct map.
//!
//! `SYS_DLOPEN`'s third argument was the one the syscall layer never validated
//! at all — sixteen bytes of arbitrary kernel memory, written by any process
//! that can call `dlopen`. `SYS_FUTEX_WAIT`'s word is the other: it was
//! guarded, but by an expression at the dispatch arm whose value was thrown
//! away, in a different file from the `pub fn` it protected. Both bounds now
//! live where they cannot be forgotten — in `translate` itself, and in
//! `futex_wait`'s signature.
//!
//! **The verdict is not the assertion.** A kernel that still made that write
//! would return the same error to a userland that cannot read a byte of the
//! kernel's address space to notice. So the kernel keeps sixteen bytes with a
//! known value and answers two questions about them
//! (`SYS_DEBUG` actions 10 and 11): where they are, and whether they still say
//! what it put there.
