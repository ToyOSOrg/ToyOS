//! A process is something you hold, and holding it is the whole of the right to
//! wait for it.
//!
//! **There is no zombie here and no parent.** A pid-keyed wait needed the
//! process table to keep a corpse until somebody claimed it, and rules for who
//! was allowed to claim one and what happened when nobody did. The exit code
//! lives on the object instead, published once by whichever of exit, kill or
//! panic recovery owns the teardown — so a wait after the fact reads a value, a
//! wait before it parks and is woken by the publish, and two holders both get
//! the answer.
//!
//! Each arm below is one sentence of that paragraph, and three of them assert
//! the *opposite* of what the pid-keyed shape did: reading the code does not
//! spend it, a process that never started the child can still wait for it, and
//! a pid on its own reaches nothing at all.
//!
//! One arm is about the wait rather than the shape.
//! `an_unrelated_wake_does_not_end_the_wait` provokes a wake that is not this
//! child's exit while the wait is parked on it, which used to return the wait
//! and panic the kernel on the exit code that was not there yet.
//!
//! Two roles besides the test. `held` exits with a code of the parent's
//! choosing, but not until its stdin closes — which is what lets every arm here
//! order the exit against the wait without a clock deciding anything. `waiter`
//! is the process that was endowed a handle to somebody else's child.
