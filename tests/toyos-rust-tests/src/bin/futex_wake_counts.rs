//! `SYS_FUTEX_WAKE` wakes **up to `count`** waiters on **this word**, and
//! answers how many — and a word whose frame is taken away ends the waits on
//! it rather than leaving them armed on somebody else's memory.
//!
//! Both halves of the first sentence are the ABI's own
//! (`toyos-abi/src/syscall.rs`: "wake up to `count` threads waiting on `addr`.
//! Returns number of threads woken"), and the completion cutover briefly
//! honoured neither. The count went to a 64-way bucket queue that nothing had
//! registered on since the park moved to the thread's own queue — so the return
//! was **provably always 0**, for every call in the machine — and the wake that
//! actually happened was an uncounted post to every waiter on the shared
//! bucket, which turns `pthread_cond_signal` into a broadcast and can spend one
//! thread's wake on a waiter of a different word.
//!
//! Nothing in the tree noticed, because nothing in the tree asks: `libc`'s
//! `pthread` discards the return, and the std fork's `RwLock::wake_writer`
//! reads a permanently-false answer as documented-but-pessimal. So this asks.
//!
//! **The two words are 256 bytes apart on purpose.** The bucket is
//! `(phys >> 2) % 64`, so words 256 bytes apart in one page land in the *same*
//! bucket by construction — which is the only way to test that a shared bucket
//! is not a shared wake. A page-aligned static is what makes their physical
//! offset equal their virtual one.
//!
//! **Three questions, and each one had to be given a schedule rather than
//! offered a race.**
//!
//! 1. [`counts`] — a count-limited wake names its word and answers how many.
//! 2. [`claim_semantics`] — a claim another call already took is neither
//!    counted nor charged against `limit`. Both are invisible unless the woken
//!    waiter is still on the bucket when the next call walks it, which is a
//!    state this test *arranges*: see the doc on that function.
//! 3. [`orphaned_by_unmap`] — a wait whose word is unmapped ends there. The
//!    token a futex waiter arms with is its word's **physical** address and
//!    nothing pins the frame, so without this the bucket keeps a node naming
//!    memory the PMM has already reissued: `mmap` hands the freshly freed frame
//!    to the next asker, and that process's `futex_wake` on the same offset
//!    wins the stale waiter's claim, is told 1 for a thread it did not wake,
//!    and leaves the real waiter parked for good. The sweeper below is another
//!    process asking exactly that question about frames this one just gave
//!    back.
