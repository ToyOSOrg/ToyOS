//! A write into a page of a `/log` file that the device will not give back.
//!
//! The host puts the file on the volume before this machine exists, so its
//! bytes are on the stick and none of its pages are in the file cache. Writing
//! *inside* it is therefore a partial write into a page that has to be fetched
//! first — `file_cache::write_page` re-reads through `FatBacking::read_page` and
//! merges — which is the one code path a failed read can silently turn into a
//! page of zeros written back over real data.
//!
//! The machine's own log reaches this path too — `/system/bin/logd` appends to an
//! ordinary file and `fsync`s every batch, so its tail page is an ordinary
//! eviction candidate and the append after it loses one is this same re-fetch.
//! A host-written file is staged instead because it makes the trigger certain
//! rather than a matter of which page happened to be evicted.
//!
//! The *read* of the same page is the other half and is the sharper of the two:
//! `file_cache::read_page` returned `()`, so a page the device would not give
//! back reached the process as zeros under a success — which nothing above it
//! can tell from a file that really is zeros there.
