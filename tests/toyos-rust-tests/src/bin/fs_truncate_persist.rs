//! `set_len` on a persistent filesystem, and running a binary out of tmpfs.
//!
//! Both are the same shape of gap: something that works in memory and stops at
//! the boundary where a mount has to describe itself to someone else. A
//! truncate dirties no page, so the flush had nothing to write and returned
//! before it reached the metadata; and tmpfs had no `open_backing`, so the
//! loader could not read a file whose pages are the file.
//!
//! /tmp is the control in both directions: it passed the truncate case before
//! the fix because its authority is the file cache itself.
