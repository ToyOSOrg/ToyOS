//! A device claim lives exactly as long as the one handle that names it.
//!
//! A claim is the machine's only arbitration: whoever holds it owns the
//! keyboard, the scanout, the NIC ring or the audio buffer, and every syscall
//! that drives one takes the handle. `dup` used to hand that back — the
//! descriptor was cloned as a plain value and `close` released the class
//! unconditionally, so `claim; dup; close` freed the device for anyone to take
//! while leaving the caller a working descriptor. On the framebuffer that is
//! two processes composing to one scanout; on the keyboard it is one process
//! reading another's keystrokes.
//!
//! The mouse is the device under test because it is the one every machine
//! shape has: `try_claim` gates the other four on a driver having registered
//! something, so on a headless boot they answer `NotFound` and prove nothing.
//!
//! **Minting is a capability now, and this binary holds one.** `SYS_OPEN_DEVICE`
//! was first-come and ungated; `SYS_DEVICE_CLAIM` needs a `SysCap` carrying
//! `Rights::DEVICE`, which reaches the test estate through test-runner and
//! reaches this binary's own children because it also carries `Rights::DUP`.
//!
//! Roles: no argument is the test; `claimer` tries to take the mouse and
//! reports what it got; `holder` takes it, says so, and waits to be killed.
