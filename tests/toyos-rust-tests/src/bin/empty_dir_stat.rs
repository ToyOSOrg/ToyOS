//! An empty directory and a path that names nothing are different answers.
//!
//! `Vfs::list` used to give both of them `NotFound`: a directory was visible
//! only through the files under it, so `mkdir("/tmp/d")` made something no
//! later call could see until something was written into it. What that cost is
//! not `readdir` — it is every tool whose two-argument form means "into this
//! directory", because `cp x d/` on a `d` that does not stat as a directory
//! silently writes a *file* named `d`.
//!
//! Asked at the syscall boundary and again through `std`, because it took a fix
//! at each: the kernel tells the two cases apart and `std`'s `is_dir` reads
//! anything the kernel accepted as a directory. A machine carrying one half and
//! not the other passes the first block below and reds in the second, which is
//! how they are kept from drifting apart again. `toybox_file_tools` is where
//! the pair is judged by a program rather than by assertions.
