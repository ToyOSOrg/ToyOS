//! A client works from its first instruction, whether or not the server has
//! reached `accept` — or has been spawned at all.
//!
//! **This is the property the retry loops were hiding.** Connecting used to be
//! resolving a name through a global registry, so a client that started first
//! found nothing and the SDK spun: two loops, one in `audio` and one in `net`,
//! each with a bound and a sleep, each turning "the server is not up yet" into a
//! duration. A port exists before either end's process does, so there is no
//! "not yet" to retry — a connection made against an acceptor nobody holds yet
//! is queued on the port, and the bytes written into it are in the ring waiting
//! when the server first looks.
//!
//! Two arms, and they must answer differently:
//!
//! 1. The client connects and writes **before the server exists**. The server is
//!    started afterwards, and at its very first look — a *non-blocking* read
//!    taken the instruction after `accept` returns — the client's frame is
//!    already there. It replies, and the client reads the reply.
//! 2. The same client, and a server that takes the acceptor and exits. The
//!    client's read answers `0` and its next write is refused. Both are facts
//!    the kernel states, not conclusions a clock reached.
//!
//! **No wall clock is asserted anywhere here, deliberately.** A tree that put a
//! retry back would not fail an arm slowly, it would *hang* — the client would
//! spin against a port that is never served — and a hang is the harness's
//! timeout to report, which is the one place in this project where a duration
//! is allowed to decide anything.
