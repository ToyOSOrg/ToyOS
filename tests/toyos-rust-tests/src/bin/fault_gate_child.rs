//! Raises one CPU exception from Ring 3, named by `argv[1]`.
//!
//! Every arm here is a plain userland instruction sequence — no syscall, no
//! privileged state. If the vector has no IDT gate the CPU escalates to #DF and
//! the machine halts, which is what `fault_gates` exists to catch.
//!
//! An arm that returns prints `survived` plus the status word that says why,
//! so a surviving arm is evidence rather than a shrug: the CPU either never
//! flagged the condition, or flagged it and declined to trap.
