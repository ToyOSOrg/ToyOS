//! A CPU exception raised by a Ring 3 process kills that process and leaves the
//! machine running.
//!
//! A vector with no IDT gate does not fault the process. The CPU takes the
//! absent gate as a second, contributory fault and escalates to #DF, and
//! `double_fault_handler` halts every CPU — so before the gates went in, the
//! first arm below took the whole guest down and this test timed out.
//!
//! **The loop is the assertion.** Arm N+1 can only run because the machine
//! survived arm N, and the `echo` at the end proves a fresh process still
//! starts. That is why the arms this environment cannot raise are still worth
//! spawning: they cost 10 ms each, and the day one of them starts faulting is
//! the day its gate has to be there.
