//! The two FAT32 partitions as ordinary mounts, from inside the machine.
//!
//! Every claim here is checked again on the host against the disk image the
//! *device* received — see `tests/common/volumes.rs`. This half exists because
//! the host cannot ask the guest's VFS anything: whether `/boot` reads as a
//! directory tree, whether a file the host wrote arrives byte-for-byte, and
//! whether the things the mount will not do are refused rather than silently
//! accepted, are all questions only a process can put.
//!
//! `/boot` is read-only toward userland and the write direction is exercised
//! on `/log`, which is the same adapter over the same driver. That split is
//! the point rather than an accident of where the files went: `/boot` is what
//! firmware and the bootloader read the machine out of, and it had no
//! permission model at all — `fs::write("/boot/toyos/kernel.elf", "TEETH")`
//! from an ordinary process truncated the kernel image to five bytes. The
//! host's byte-for-byte check of the build artifacts is the other half of
//! that; this half is the attack.
