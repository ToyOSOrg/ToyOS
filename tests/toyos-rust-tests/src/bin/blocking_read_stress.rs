//! The lost-wake canary: a pipe ping-pong across processes, counted.
//!
//! Every round trip here is two parks and two posts on the completion core —
//! the reader blocks in `sys_read` on an empty pipe, the writer's post wakes
//! it, and the same happens back the other way. **The verdict is a count
//! inside a wall-clock bound**, never a hang: a stall is disqualified as a
//! verdict, because the harness prints "the guard expired, so this says
//! nothing about the tree" beside one and tells nobody to bisect it. A
//! dropped completion reds as a number that is short of `ROUNDS`, with the
//! round it stopped at named.
//!
//! The echo half is this same binary with an argument, so the two ends are one
//! file and the child's own parks are the same parks the parent's are.
