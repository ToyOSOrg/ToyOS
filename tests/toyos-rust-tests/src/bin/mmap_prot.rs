//! Memory protection, which the kernel used to discard in both directions.
//!
//! `sys_mmap`'s third argument was named `_prot`. Every mapping came back
//! readable and writable whatever the caller asked for, so
//! `userland/libc`'s translation of POSIX `PROT_NONE` produced a writable
//! guard page and the stack-overflow detection a C program builds on it
//! silently did not exist.
//!
//! **And every mapping came back executable**, because `EFER.NXE` was set
//! nowhere and no paging entry in the machine carried the `XD` bit — while
//! `.text` came back *writable* wherever it shared a 2 MiB window with `.data`,
//! which is 14 of the 20 binaries in the boot set. So this file also holds the
//! two halves of W^X: what may be written may not be executed, and what may be
//! executed may not be written.
//!
//! Each refusal is checked in a child, because the whole point is that the
//! access kills the process — and the parent then asks whether the machine is
//! still there.
