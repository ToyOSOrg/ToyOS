//! A thread killed while blocked on a handle still gives the handle back.
//!
//! **This is the handle property that matters most for this architecture, and
//! nothing in the tree executed it.**
//!
//! `handle_count` is deliberately not the `Arc` count (`kernel/src/object/`).
//! The reason is exactly this shape: a blocking syscall clones an `Arc` out of
//! the table before it parks, this kernel does not unwind, and a thread another
//! CPU kills never runs a destructor — so that `Arc` is stranded on a kernel
//! stack that is simply freed. If EOF and dead-peer detection rode `Arc`
//! counts, killing a client blocked in its signal-pipe read would leak the read
//! end and the server would never learn. That is the steady state of every cpal
//! client, so "never learn" means soundd writing into a ring nobody reads for
//! the rest of the boot.
//!
//! Four arms, each a child killed at a point it cannot come back from:
//!
//! 1. **Blocked reading a pipe.** The parent holds the only write end and must
//!    see the read side gone.
//! 2. **Blocked reading an IPC connection**, which is the soundd shape one
//!    layer up: the parent's write must answer `Gone`.
//! 3. **Blocked in `accept`.** The child holds the port's only acceptor; the
//!    parent's next connect through the connector must be `Gone`.
//! 4. **Not blocked at all** — spinning in Ring 3, with an empty kernel stack
//!    and no syscall to cancel. The other three ask what a kill *releases*;
//!    this one asks whether it **ends** — "a killed thread is never dispatched
//!    into userland again", the claim about a kill that no other test in this
//!    tree executes. It is the one arm that does not issue
//!    its own kill: a `kill` that does not end its target does not return
//!    either, so the killer is a process of its own and this one only watches.
//!
//! **No census assertion anywhere in this file, and that is the point rather
//! than an omission.** A live-object count is the one instrument that cannot
//! judge these three: a thread parked in `accept` has cloned the `Arc` out of
//! its table onto its own kernel stack, so killing it strands that `Arc` on
//! memory that is freed without unwinding and the object stays *alive* — which
//! this design accepts and says so (`kernel/src/object/`). What must not
//! survive is the **handle count**, because that is what every peer-visible
//! event rides. So each arm asks a peer, and none of them counts objects.
//!
//! **The marker is what gives every arm teeth.** Without it a child killed
//! before it reached its `read` would pass while asserting nothing — the handle
//! would have been released by an ordinary table drain with no `Arc` stranded
//! anywhere, which is the case that is *not* under test.

/// the victim's handle table and in no other, so the read end this process
/// holds reaches EOF when — and only when — the victim's handles are drained.
/// That is `kill_process`'s phase 3, which runs after `retire_task` has seen
/// the victim released, which the victim publishes from its own pass out of
/// `exit_if_killed` — the last exit boundary itself. EOF is downstream of the
/// boundary by a teardown and by nothing that can wait, and it is unreachable
