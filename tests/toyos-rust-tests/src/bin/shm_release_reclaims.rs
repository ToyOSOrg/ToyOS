//! Dropping the last handle to a shared region must give the pages back.
//!
//! `SYS_RELEASE_SHARED` unmapped the caller and dropped it from the region's
//! `allowed` list, and stopped there: the "is anyone left?" test lived only in
//! `cleanup_process`, so nothing freed a region at close time and soundd's
//! per-client ring stayed resident until some unrelated process exited. There
//! is no release call now — a region's life is its handle count, and the
//! zero-handle hook is where the mappings go.
//!
//! Two directions, because a reclaim rule that is too eager is worse than one
//! that never fires: a region whose maker has dropped its handle but which it
//! **sent** to somebody must survive, and that somebody must still be able to
//! read it. Run as `... donor` this binary is that maker.
