//! Which handle failures end the caller, and which ones it is allowed to see.
//!
//! **Three of the five are bugs in the process that named the handle.** A
//! handle is a local name a process was given, so naming one it does not hold
//! (`BadHandle`), one it closed (`Stale`), or asking a pipe to accept a
//! connection (`WrongType`) is not something a correct program can do — and a
//! word it can ignore lets the bug survive. The other two are not: a process
//! may legitimately hold an attenuated handle and probe what it can do with it,
//! and a table with no room is a resource limit.
//!
//! So the policy is a matrix and this is its gate. Each fatal kind is raised in
//! a child, which prints its marker, makes the one call and must never print
//! again; each survivable kind is raised here, where the answer is a word and
//! the process carries on to raise the next.
//!
//! **The marker is what gives the fatal arms teeth.** Without it a child that
//! died before reaching the call would pass, and the arm would assert nothing.
//! With it, a tree that put the three error words back reds on the exit code
//! while still printing the marker, and a tree that killed for all five reds on
//! the two survivable arms.
//!
//! The census arm is next. `handle_count` reaching zero is what releases an
//! object, and a kill is the path where nothing unwinds — so a leak per killed
//! process is exactly the defect this policy could introduce and the only place
//! it is visible is the kernel's own live-object count.
//!
//! **The last arms are the same matrix asked through a `POLL_ADD`, which is
//! where the kernel had a third answer nobody had written down.**
//! `process_poll_add` resolved its handle through one `let … else` that
//! swallowed `BadHandle`, `Stale` and a missing `Rights::WAIT` alike, and then
//! pushed a pending poll carrying no source — which no event site can reach and
//! no recheck can complete. A program that polled a handle it had already
//! closed was therefore neither answered nor ended: it went quiet. A submission
//! does have an error channel — the CQE — and these arms are what say so, one
//! per kind, plus the direction in which an object has no readiness at all.
//!
//! **`retired-stale` is `stale` at the end of a slot's life rather than in the
//! middle of it.** A generation counter is finite, and by owner ruling of
//! 2026-08-20 a slot that spends its last one retires instead of starting
//! again — so a handle to it names a slot the table no longer has. The answer
//! must be the same kill, and the answer that would be a defect is the one a
//! wrapping counter gives: the object, alive again, to whoever kept the number.
//! `handle_basic` is where the retirement itself is asserted; here it is only
//! the policy, which is the half that must not quietly become survivable
//! because the slot is now a different kind of gone.
//!
//! **`spawn-stale` is the one arm that is not a call refusing its own
//! argument.** A slot map is a parent deciding what its child is born holding,
//! and the kernel skipped a pair it could not resolve — so the child started
//! without a capability its parent had named and could not tell that from
//! having asked for nothing, while the parent was told its spawn happened as
//! asked. That is silent degradation of a capability, which is the one thing
//! this policy exists to remove, and the owner ruled it a kill on 2026-08-19.
//! The rule keeps exactly one exception and this is not it
//! (`kernel/src/object/handle.rs`).
