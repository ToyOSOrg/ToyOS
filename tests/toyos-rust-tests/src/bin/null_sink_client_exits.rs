//! A client that plays through the null sink must finish and exit.
//!
//! `/system/bin/tone` and not this crate's own tone: the T14 hangs on the shipped
//! binary, which reaches soundd through `cpal`, while the raw-API tone that
//! `metal_sim_null_audio` runs drains perfectly on the same sink. Whatever the
//! defect is, only the path a user actually takes shows it — which is why this
//! spawns the program the shell spawns rather than linking the SDK directly.
//!
//! Two of them in series, because one hung client is what the T14 log shows
//! blocking the *next* connect: if the first exits and the second hangs, the
//! sink stops draining after a run rather than never starting.
