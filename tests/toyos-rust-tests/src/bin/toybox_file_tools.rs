//! `cp`, `mv` and `hexdump` as a user reaches them: spawned from `/bin`, judged
//! on their exit code and on their bytes.
//!
//! The three claims that are not "it works":
//!
//! - **`cp` streams.** The source is larger than `cp`'s own flush interval
//!   twice over and is not a page multiple, so the periodic-flush path and the
//!   partial tail both run. Nothing in a process can prove the *absence* of a
//!   file-sized allocation, but this is the workload that reaches the constants
//!   that rule one out.
//! - **`cp` never leaves a short file under the destination's name.** Every
//!   refusal below is checked for the destination it must not have touched and
//!   for the `.part` sibling it must not have left.
//! - **`mv` does not copy behind the caller's back.** A move between mounts is
//!   refused and both ends survive. If a copy-and-delete fallback is ever
//!   added, this goes red — which is the point: `sys_rename` reports one error
//!   for every cause, so such a fallback would fire on a broken rename too and
//!   hide it.
//! - **A rename that reports success moved the file.** Both `cp` and `mv` run
//!   on `/home` here, where a rename used to insert the entry under the new
//!   name and then delete that same entry, freeing the file's blocks on the
//!   way out. Every claim below is about bytes on the other side of the move,
//!   because that failure returned `Ok(())` and left both names absent.
//!
//! `hexdump`'s expected output is not computed here. It is the byte-for-byte
//! output of the host's own `xxd` over the same 25 bytes, pasted in, so the
//! format is judged by something that is not this project.
//!
//! Every directory this test makes is left empty, which is the harder case and
//! until recently the broken one: `cp x emptydir/` wrote a *file* named
//! `emptydir`, because both halves of `is_dir` read "no entries" as "no such
//! path". Both halves are fixed and this is where the pair is judged together —
//! `/system/bin/cp` asks `fs::metadata`, which asks `readdir`, which asks the kernel.
