//! `#DB` raised from Ring 3, which is a userland bug and not a debugger session.
//!
//! **A Ring 3 process can raise `#DB` whenever it likes, and it needs no
//! privilege to do it.** `RFLAGS.TF` is not a privileged bit — a `popfq` sets
//! it, and the instruction after that traps — and `INT1` (opcode `0xF1`) raises
//! the vector directly, without the DPL check `INT n` performs against the gate.
//! So both arms below are ordinary userland instruction sequences, and both are
//! things a program can do by accident.
//!
//! Neither may reach a kernel report path. `#DB`'s handler used to be a
//! debugger-session aid — a marker straight out the UART, a `DR7`/`DR6` disarm,
//! `DR0` read back, a symbol resolved and a backtrace walked — and it *returned
//! to resume*, so a Ring 3 trap made the kernel walk kernel state on a user
//! fault and then carry on. With `TF` still set the resumed instruction traps
//! again, which is a report per instruction for as long as the process runs.
//!
//! This is the gate on the answer: `#DB` from Ring 3 is the process's fault and
//! ends it, exactly as `#BP` and `#UD` from Ring 3 do. The parent asserts the
//! child reached its trap and never spoke again; `check_debug_trap` in
//! `tests/toyos.rs` asserts the *kernel's* half out of the serial capture — that
//! it named the vector in a Ring 3 report, and that the watchpoint report is not
//! in the capture at all.
