//! The desktop must survive a client that stops talking, stops listening, or
//! never stops.
//!
//! Every one of these cases used to park the compositor's whole event loop in
//! a kernel wait with no deadline — no redraws, no input, nothing — because
//! the compositor read and wrote its clients with blocking calls. The one
//! written up in `issues/isolation/` is the second case here: a client
//! that connects and sends four bytes, met by `ipc::recv_header` on a freshly
//! accepted connection.
//!
//! Each case sets its stall up and leaves it standing, then asks the
//! compositor a question **with a deadline**. That is the shape the assertion
//! has to have: a frozen compositor turns any unbounded call into a hung boot,
//! and a hung boot names no defect. The host side asserts the other half —
//! that the desktop is still *painting*, and that every client dropped along
//! the way was named in the log.
