//! `SYS_SET_THREAD_NAME` used to clamp an oversized name with `(a2 as
//! usize).min(THREAD_NAME_LEN)` and set the truncated prefix — a silent
//! clamp, and the shape
//! `issues/isolation/untrusted-sites-not-yet-adopted.md` named for the
//! whole of `kernel/src/arch/syscall/`. `Untrusted::at_most` replaced it
//! with a refusal, which is a behaviour change worth its own gate: this
//! proves the refusal actually fires, rather than the clamp it replaced.
//!
//! `toyos_abi::syscall::set_thread_name` throws its own return value away —
//! it always has, and that is not this test's to fix — so the return code
//! cannot be what proves the refusal. `SYS_SYSINFO` is the only other way
//! userland reads a thread's name back, and it is enough: this checks that a
//! call over the bound leaves the name exactly as it was, never a silently
//! truncated prefix nobody asked for. The old clamp would have this reading
//! back a truncated `over` after the second call; the refusal reads back
//! `at_bound`, unchanged.
