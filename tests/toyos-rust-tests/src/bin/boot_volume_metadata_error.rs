//! What a mount says when its device stops answering the questions that used
//! to have no channel: is this file there, what is in this directory, when was
//! it written.
//!
//! `vfs::FileSystem` answered every one of those with an `Option`, a `bool` or
//! a bare `u64`, so a volume that refused a transfer was reported as a name
//! that is not there. That is the one degradation a caller cannot act on: it
//! creates a file over one that exists, reports a program missing off a stick
//! that is merely unhappy, and unlinks a name it believes is already gone.
//!
//! The kernel is built with `fat-boot-reads-fail`, which fails every read of
//! the boot volume *under `Fat32`* — a directory entry, a FAT chain, an extent
//! list — from the moment the mount finishes. Nothing else in the machine is
//! touched, and the `/log` check at the end is what says so: a refusal that
//! costs the whole machine is not a fix, and one that reads as machine-wide
//! would prove nothing about this volume.
//!
//! The kind is printed rather than asserted here, because the assertion belongs
//! on the host side beside the log it is judged against — see
//! `tests/common/volumes.rs`.
