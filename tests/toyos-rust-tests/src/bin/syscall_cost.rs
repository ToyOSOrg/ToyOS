//! What a transition out of Ring 3 costs, in cycles.
//!
//! The syscall entry, which is the busiest of the five places `arch::entry`'s
//! bracket sits. The exception entry pays the same two instructions, and there
//! is no cheap way to measure it here: the only demand-paged memory a userland
//! program can reach is its own file-backed pages — `sys_mmap` allocates and
//! maps its whole region up front — so a workload of N faults costs N × 2 MiB
//! of test image.
//!
//! **No threshold, and the host reads the numbers instead.** A bound measured
//! under TCG is meaningless — QEMU implements `FXSAVE` as a helper call and
//! prices nothing like silicon — and one measured on metal drifts. The number
//! is for a same-session A/B against another build of this tree; what the host
//! refuses is a counter that did not move (`check_syscall_cost`).
//!
//! Reported as the minimum over repetitions rather than the mean: the minimum
//! is the run with the least interference, and on a host running eleven other
//! guests interference is all the mean measures.
