//! Sustained pressure on both disk caches, and the one question a cache that
//! evicts has to answer: does a page that was thrown away come back as the
//! bytes that were written?
//!
//! Everything here is sized in pages against the `test-small-caches` budget of
//! 64 of them. `BIG_PAGES` is twice that, so the forward pass evicts the head
//! of the file before it reaches the tail and the reverse pass then re-reads
//! every page in the order that guarantees a miss on each one. `SMALL_FILES`
//! exists because the eviction sweep walks (file, page) order, and a single
//! file cannot exercise the step from one file to the next.
//!
//! At the shipped budget the same run fits in cache and proves only the round
//! trip, which is why the harness asserts on the kernel's own eviction series
//! rather than on this exit code alone.
//!
//! `BIG_PAGES` is sized against the cache and nothing else. It used to be
//! capped near 250 by the filesystem — one inline extent per page against a
//! 4040-byte btree value — which is how that panic was found; `fs_large_file`
//! now covers the fixed version at four times the old ceiling.
