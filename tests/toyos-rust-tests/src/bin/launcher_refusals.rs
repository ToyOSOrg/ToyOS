//! What a client can make `/system/bin/init` do by sending it a bad launch.
//!
//! **init is the one process the machine cannot lose.** It holds the only
//! `SysCap`, every unhanded acceptor and the `launcher` port, and nothing
//! restarts it — so a client that can end it, panic it or grow its handle
//! table without bound takes the machine's ability to start a process with it.
//! Every field of `MSG_LAUNCH` and every handle in its batch is a client's
//! claim about itself, and the launcher connector is held by the compositor,
//! every terminal, every shell and sshd.
//!
//! Three shapes, each of which was reachable before this gate existed:
//!
//! 1. **A frame whose handle count is not the batch's.** The handles are
//!    already in init's table when the count is checked, so a refusal that
//!    returns without closing them leaks one per attempt — and a client picks
//!    how often it attempts. Measured against the kernel's live-object census
//!    rather than believed: the batch is a duplicate of a pipe end this
//!    process then drops, so the object survives exactly if init kept it.
//! 2. **An extra that is not a connector.** init has no way to ask what a
//!    handle it received names, so it hands it to `SYS_NAMESPACE_BUILD` — and
//!    a wrong type there used to end the caller, which is init.
//! 3. **A connector the client narrowed `DUP` away from.** init duplicates a
//!    provided connector so the namespace and the label can both carry one; a
//!    duplicate that is refused used to be an `.expect`.
//!
//! The fourth arm is what stops the other three passing on a dead launcher: an
//! ordinary spawn, which goes through init because this process holds a
//! `launcher` connector and `/system/bin/toybox` is a declared program. It runs last,
//! so it also asserts init survived all three.
//!
//! **A fourth shape, and it is the one init could not survive at all: a client
//! that connects and says nothing.** `serve_launch`'s first statement was a
//! blocking `recv_header` on the fresh connection, so two syscalls from any
//! holder of the connector — the compositor, every terminal, every shell, sshd
//! — parked the machine's only way to start a process for ever, with init alive
//! and looking healthy.
//!
//! **Every answer this file waits for is bounded, and that is not decoration.**
//! A test that hangs instead of failing is worse than no test: a harness
//! timeout is a liveness guard rather than a verdict, and a guest that never
//! returns takes its whole shared boot down with it. So the launcher's replies
//! are read with [`answer_within`], and a launcher that has stopped answering
//! is an assertion with a name on it. The one arm that cannot be bounded from
//! here — `Command`, which blocks inside `std` — runs after a bounded launch
//! has already proved init is answering.
