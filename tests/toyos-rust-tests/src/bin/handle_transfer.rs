//! A batch of handles crossing a connection, and what happens at each point a
//! peer can die.
//!
//! Nothing in the tree was this gate: the only two `handle_send` call sites in
//! the whole test estate sent a `SharedMem`, which is why three of this
//! branch's defects lived here unseen.
//!
//! Five arms, one per point a batch can be at.
//!
//! 1. **The peer is already gone.** The send answers `Gone` and **the handles
//!    are still the sender's**. That is not a nicety: the batch used to be
//!    taken out of the table and dropped on the refusal, so a caller told
//!    `ResourceExhausted` — ordinary backpressure — had silently lost the
//!    capabilities it was about to retry with, and its own `close` of one was
//!    `Stale`, which ends it. `/system/bin/init` was that caller.
//! 2. **The queue is full.** `MAX_QUEUED_BATCHES` refuses by name, and the
//!    refused batch is still the sender's for the same reason.
//! 3. **Sent and never received.** The peer dies holding the batch; the queue
//!    releases it, and the census says so per kind.
//! 4. **Sent by a peer that then died.** The batch is still there and still
//!    works: what a process sent is the receiver's, not something its exit
//!    retracts.
//! 5. **An `immediate` object inside a `deferred` one.** `kobject!` classifies
//!    each object, and a `deferred` container may hold an `immediate` member: a
//!    dirty `File` sent over a connection whose peer dies is flushed from
//!    `drain_zero_handles`. Nothing in the tree constructed that before, which
//!    is why the suite was green over it.
//!
//! Every arm is followed by the per-kind census, because a total hides a leak
//! of one kind behind churn in another.
