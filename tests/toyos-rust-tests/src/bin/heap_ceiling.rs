//! The kernel heap's ceiling, and what it costs the machine to cross it.
//!
//! `KernelPageSource` hands dlmalloc one 2 MiB page and can hand it no more,
//! so `mm::MAX_HEAP_ALLOC` is the largest single allocation the kernel heap
//! can serve. Asking for more is a kernel bug and dies loudly — but the check
//! used to live *inside* `KernelAllocator::alloc`'s lock, and the kernel does
//! not unwind, so the heap stayed locked and the CPU that recovered from the
//! panic spun forever on its next allocation or free. Reporting the bug cost
//! the machine.
//!
//! Three cases, because no one of them says it alone: the ceiling is servable,
//! a request the page source cannot back is refused rather than fatal, and one
//! past the ceiling kills its caller and nothing else.
