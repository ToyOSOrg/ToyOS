//! Two processes, two `write`s per line, and not one line that belongs to
//! both.
//!
//! **The defect this is aimed at is a `write` syscall being the unit of
//! interleaving.** `println!` is a `LineWriter`: it issues `flush_buf()` and
//! then `inner.write(rest)`, so a line reaches the kernel in two pieces with an
//! arbitrary gap between them, and anything else writing the console in that
//! gap lands inside the line.
//! Two splices were recorded against it before it was closed, one of them a
//! measured 1 run in 10 for `desktop_audio_client` on CI;
//! `src/redlist.rs`'s retired rows keep both measurements, because the
//! issue file that held them is closed and its numbers are still numbers.
//! `ConsoleObject`'s line buffer is what closes it, and the buffer is per
//! holder — so two *processes* is the shape that tests it and two threads
//! would not.
//!
//! The two writes are made by hand rather than through `println!` because the
//! split has to be the subject rather than an implementation detail of `std`:
//! the line is a fixed width, the gap is exactly in the middle, and the newline
//! is on the second write, which is the piece the buffer is waiting for.
//!
//! The verdict is the host's — a line is mixed or it is not, and only the
//! console capture can say. What this binary owes the host is that both writers
//! ran, said how much, and agreed about it.
