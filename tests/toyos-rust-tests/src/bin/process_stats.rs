//! `SYS_PROCESS_STATS`, which is now a question about an object rather than a
//! claim on a snapshot.
//!
//! Three things changed with the handle and all three are asserted here: a
//! *live* process answers, an exited one keeps answering, and answering twice
//! gives the same numbers. The old shape — a snapshot the parent could read
//! exactly once, only after the child died — is what the third case used to
//! assert the opposite of.
//!
//! A fourth asks what the numbers *mean*. `blocked_io_ns`, `blocked_futex_ns`,
//! `blocked_pipe_ns` and `blocked_ipc_ns` are four fields and not one because
//! the breakdown is the instrument — it was built for the T14 wedge
//! investigation, where "this process is blocked" was already known and
//! "blocked on what" was the question. They are only four fields while
//! something says which; when every park went in as `WaitClass::Other` they
//! were permanently zero, and nothing here noticed.
