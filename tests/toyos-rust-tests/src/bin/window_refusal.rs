//! A client must survive a compositor that says no.
//!
//! The window protocol had no refusal message at all: the only answer to
//! `MSG_CREATE_WINDOW` was `MSG_WINDOW_CREATED`, so a compositor that could not
//! afford another window had no move except to serve it or drop the connection,
//! and `Window::create` met anything else with `assert_eq!` — a client killed
//! by an answer it should have been able to read.
//!
//! **This binary plays the compositor, and how it does that is the point.** It
//! used to squat `services::listen("compositor")` on a boot where no compositor
//! ran, which worked because any process could take any name. There is no name
//! to take now. Instead it creates a port, builds a namespace mapping
//! `"compositor"` to that port's connector, and spawns a child holding it: the
//! child's `Window::create` reaches this process and nothing else, no other
//! process can see the service, and the same four answers are reachable from
//! one binary. That is the pattern every hostile-server test uses from here.
//!
//! Roles: no argument is the server; `client` is the child that asks for a
//! window and decodes what comes back.
