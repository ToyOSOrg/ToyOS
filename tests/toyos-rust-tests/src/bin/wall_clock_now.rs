//!
//! The host stages the RTC with `-rtc base=` and reads the *name* of the file
//! the kernel writes, which is local time. Neither of those can see
//! `SYS_CLOCK_EPOCH`, which serves UTC — and the difference between the two is
//! the whole of the timezone question. This prints both so the host can put
//! them against the instant it set, in `tests/common/wallclock.rs`.
//!
//! What it asserts itself is only what holds on *every* machine, because it
//! runs on four of them: the shared boot, and the three whose clocks are staged
//! broken. A machine with no wall clock is not a failure here — printing that
//! it has none is the answer the host is checking for.
