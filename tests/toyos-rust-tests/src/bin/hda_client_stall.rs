//! A client that stops producing mid-stream, on a machine whose audio device
//! is a cyclic DMA ring.
//!
//! The stall is the whole actuator. soundd's mix loop may leave a freed period
//! unfilled while a streaming client is still producing it, and on
//! virtio-sound that costs nothing: a period soundd has not submitted is a
//! period the device does not have. HDA's engine owns every period for as long
//! as it runs and replays the ones nobody refilled, so a period held across a
//! lap is completed a second time — which is what killed soundd on the T14.
//!
//! Nothing in the ordinary tone clients reaches that state: they keep their
//! ring full, so soundd never defers at all (`deferred=0` on every `hda_tone`
//! run measured). This one empties it on purpose, for longer than the ring
//! takes to come round.
