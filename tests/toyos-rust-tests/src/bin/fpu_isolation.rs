//! What a transition out of Ring 3 preserves.
//!
//! Three arms, all positive assertions, and each one fails on the tree that
//! came before the bracket in `kernel/src/arch/entry.rs`:
//!
//! 1. **Leak.** One process pins a distinctive FP state and exits without
//!    restoring it; the next asserts the *declared* state at its own entry.
//! 2. **Fault.** `fault_gate_child mf` dies with an unmasked x87 exception
//!    pending; the next process executes `FLDCW` — a waiting instruction — and
//!    must survive. That is the defect CI proved by one token: `std_unwind`'s
//!    victim was the `FLDCW` inside the unwinder's `restore_context`, and every
//!    ToyOS binary executes one on every panic.
//! 3. **Preservation.** One process pins a state, forces many transitions of
//!    each kind — syscall, demand page fault, timer preemption — against an
//!    FP-heavy sibling, and asserts bit-identity.
//!
//! **It is run at `smp=1`, and that is the stronger choice rather than the
//! weaker one.** The defect is a CPU register file carrying over between tasks,
//! so an arm only means anything when the two tasks share a CPU. With more CPUs
//! that is a coin flip, which is why CI's observation of it was intermittent.
