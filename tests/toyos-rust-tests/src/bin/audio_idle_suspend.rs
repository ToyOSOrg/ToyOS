//! Idle-suspend certification: on a boot where no audio client ever
//! connects, soundd's CPU cost is exactly zero. Two sysinfo samples ~1s apart
//! must show no cpu_ns movement on any soundd thread — a suspended soundd
//! holds no timer and takes no wakes, so any nonzero delta is the mix or
//! control loop running without a reason. This is the one idle-suspend claim gate A
//! structurally cannot see: its counters are streaming-scoped, and its boots
//! always connect a client. No wav analysis — there is no signal, and the
//! capture freezes while the voice is stopped anyway.
//!
//! Another process's threads is the process roster, which costs
//! `Rights::ROSTER` on a `SysCap` — `tests/testcases` names `roster` on the
//! test-runner row and every binary it spawns holds the duplicate. A capability
//! this binary does not hold is a config fact and says so, rather than reading
//! back zero soundd threads and calling that a suspended daemon.
