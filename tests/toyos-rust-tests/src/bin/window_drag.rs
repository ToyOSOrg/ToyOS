//! A window the host drags by its title bar, reporting from inside where the
//! pointer landed.
//!
//! Needs a live compositor, which the shared boot does not have — it is in
//! `RUST_SKIP` and `metal_sim_window_drag` runs it on the metal-sim profile.
//!
//! It exists because the host cannot see where a window is. The compositor
//! places one and tells the client its size and nothing else, so a test that
//! aimed at a title bar from arithmetic would be a test that agrees with a copy
//! of the compositor's own layout constants. Instead this prints the
//! *content-local* coordinates of every press it is given, which is a
//! measurement of where the window is: the host clicks a known screen pixel,
//! reads back what that pixel is called in here, and has the window's origin.
//! The same press after a drag is what proves the window moved, and by how far.
//!
//! Small on purpose. The point of the run is that dragging a window costs the
//! area of the window, so a window that filled the screen would pass a gate
//! about screen-sized damage without meaning anything.
