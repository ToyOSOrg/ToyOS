//! `SYS_GPU_SET_RESOLUTION` must be reachable only through the framebuffer
//! claim.
//!
//! It turns two arbitrary `u32`s into `width * height * 4` bytes of contiguous
//! physical memory, so an ungated caller both reconfigures the display and
//! names a kernel allocation size.
//!
//! **The gate used to be a pid comparison** — "is the caller the process that
//! opened the device?" — and the claim is the argument now, so what this binary
//! presents is the two things a process without one can present: nothing, and
//! a handle that is not a claim.
//!
//! **Both of those now end the caller rather than answering it**, which is why
//! every arm is a child. A handle a process does not hold and a handle of the
//! wrong type are bugs in that process, not conditions to report, so the
//! refusal is `exit 139` and a line in the kernel log — and a test that asserted
//! the old error words would be asserting that the bug is survivable. The child
//! prints its marker before the call, so an arm cannot pass by dying on the way
//! to it.
//!
//! One arm answers instead of killing, and it is here to keep the other four
//! honest: a handle that resolves and carries the wrong *rights* is a question
//! a process is allowed to ask, so it comes back as `PermissionDenied` and this
//! process carries on to the next arm.
