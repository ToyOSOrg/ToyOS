//! **What raising a wake storm costs the thread that raises it.**
//!
//! `Watch::post_n` walks the waiters registered on one word, claims each one
//! and posts a message to its home CPU — one loop, on the caller's CPU, before
//! the syscall returns. `toyos-sched/sim`'s wakeup-storm case measures how long
//! the *waiters* then take to reach a CPU and can say nothing whatever about
//! that loop: the model's clock does not advance inside a step, so raising a
//! storm of any size is free there. The cost is a guest measurement, and this
//! is it.
//!
//! **The derivation, off the loop itself.** The body is a token comparison and
//! one `notify` of the waiter's word per waiter, so the cost is
//! `fixed + N × per-waiter` — linear in the waiters on the word, with a
//! constant that has nothing to do with N. That shape is what is asserted:
//! quadrupling the storm may cost four times the loop, and a quarter more on
//! top, which is the same allowance `a_wakeup_storm_drains_without_serializing`
//! states about the drain. Anything past it is a term that grows with the
//! storm and is not the walk — a lock somebody takes per waiter, a scan of the
//! whole bucket per claim.
//!
//! **The absolute numbers are printed and never asserted**, for
//! `syscall_cost`'s reason: a threshold measured under TCG is meaningless —
//! QEMU prices an uncontended atomic read-modify-write nothing like silicon,
//! and this loop is made of them — and one measured on metal drifts. What
//! transfers is the *ratio*, which is dimensionless.
//!
//! **The instrument is `rdtsc` around the syscall, and it is the tree's
//! own.** `SYS_PROCESS_STATS` answers per *process*, and the waker and its 64
//! waiters are one process here; the scheduler dump reports queues rather than
//! costs; and a per-waiter kernel counter would be a kernel addition. What a
//! syscall costs its caller is exactly what `syscall_cost` reads this way.
//!
//! **What it measured**, on this host's TCG guest at `--smp 2`, minimum of nine
//! timed calls per width, two runs of the same tree:
//!
//! | waiters | run 1 | run 2 |
//! |---|---|---|
//! |  1 |  7,000 |  7,000 |
//! |  2 |  7,000 |  8,000 |
//! |  4 |  7,000 | 11,000 |
//! |  8 | 10,000 | 18,000 |
//! | 16 | 14,000 | 20,000 |
//! | 32 | 23,000 | 21,000 |
//! | 64 | 33,000 | 38,000 |
//!
//! So **raising a 64-waiter storm costs its waker 33–38 µs of its own CPU** at
//! this guest's 998 MHz, which is a third of one percent of a 10 ms quantum,
//! and the marginal cost is 412–492 cycles per waiter claimed. Quadrupling the
//! storm from 16 to 64 costs 2.4× and 1.9× the walk rather than 4×, because the
//! fixed part of the call is a third of the 16-waiter figure.
//!
//! **The middle of the sweep is not monotone between runs** — 32 waiters read
//! under 8 in the second — and the reason is the instrument rather than the
//! kernel: this guest's TSC advances in steps of about a thousand cycles, so
//! the resolution is a microsecond and the whole per-waiter term below eight
//! waiters is inside it, and a minimum of nine calls on a two-CPU guest sharing
//! a host with eleven others still carries the host's descheduling. The two
//! endpoints are five times apart, which is why the assertions are stated at 1,
//! 16 and 64 and never between neighbours.
//!
//! **On a hosted KVM shard the walk is below the instrument altogether.** Run
//! 32574408810's `guest (1)` (EPYC, TSC 2,445 MHz, twelve shards on the
//! service's hosts, 2026-08-22) read 30,331 cycles at one waiter, 22,246 at
//! 16 and 28,200 at 64: the fixed part of the call is ~12 µs there and the
//! shard's own descheduling moves a minimum of nine by more than the whole
//! per-waiter term, so the endpoints came out inverted and the first
//! assertion, as then written, reded a pull request about DMA views. Whether
//! the walk is readable is therefore the instrument's verdict, printed, and
//! the ratio is asserted only on a run that can read it — the TCG guest
//! above can; the hosted shard records its numbers and makes no claim.
//!
//! **Every waiter is proved parked before the call that is timed**, by the
//! answer that call gives: a wake with no limit over `want` parked, unclaimed
//! waiters answers `want` under every arithmetic, and one that answers anything
//! else is discarded rather than measured. The word never changes while the
//! storms are raised, so a claimed waiter re-derives its predicate, finds it
//! false and re-parks — which is what makes the same word measurable at seven
//! widths in one run.
