//! A process's `cwd` must not be able to grow without bound.
//!
//! `MAX_USER_STR` (64 KiB) bounds every path *argument*, and its derivation
//! says the number is set by the largest allocation derived from it. But
//! `Vfs::resolve_absolute` prepends `cwd` before handing the result to
//! `normalize`, and `cwd` was bounded by nothing — so the input the constant
//! was sized against stopped being the input `normalize` saw. A bound defeated
//! by composition: the check was real, the assumption behind it had quietly
//! stopped holding.
//!
//! The amplifier is that `mkdir` does no existence check — `create_dir` just
//! inserts the resolved string into a set, and `cd` accepts anything in that
//! set. So `mkdir(rel); chdir(rel)` appends ~64 KiB per round with no
//! filesystem involvement at all, and about thirty rounds put a `format!`
//! past the kernel heap's 2 MiB single-allocation ceiling — an assert taken
//! *inside the allocator lock*, which wedges the recovered CPU's next alloc.
//!
//! Roughly sixty syscalls from plain std, no crafted ELF, no large-RAM guest.
//! Before the fix this panics the kernel; after it, every over-long `chdir` is
//! a clean error and `cwd` stays bounded.
