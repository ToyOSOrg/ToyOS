//! `read_dir` must return every entry or an error, never a short listing.
//!
//! Two defects, and the second is what makes the first's bound honest. The
//! kernel built a directory listing with one entry per file and no cap, so a
//! `read_dir` over 32,769 files in one tmpfs directory panicked it — measured,
//! 1.8 s, from `fs::write` in a loop. And `SYS_READDIR` filled the caller's
//! buffer, stopped, and reported the bytes it had written, which is
//! indistinguishable from a complete listing: 4125 entries of 34,816, as
//! success. A bound plus a silent truncation is a quieter version of the same
//! defect, so both are asserted here.
//!
//! `/home` gets the same class third: its filesystem walks a btree rather
//! than a map, and the walk materialised the whole tree before the mount
//! bound ran — past 32,768 live entries its doubling `Vec` crossed the
//! kernel's allocation ceiling, a panic from ordinary `create` calls. The
//! walk now refuses at the bound before anything materialises.
//!
//! Everything below is an ordinary workload — no kernel feature, no injection.
