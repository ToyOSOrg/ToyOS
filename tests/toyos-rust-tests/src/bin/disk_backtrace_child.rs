//! Dereferences null so the kernel prints a SEGFAULT report for it.

//! Distinct from `segfault_child` only in the name of the function that faults,
//! and that is the whole point: `disk_backtrace` copies this binary onto a disk
//! and runs it from there, so the report has to name a symbol no *other* boot
//! could have put in the same capture window. `segfault_child` runs from ROOT
//! in the same suite.
