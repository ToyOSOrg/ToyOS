//! A number another process published designates nothing here.
//!
//! This test used to sweep `SYS_PIPE_OPEN` over the dense machine-wide `PipeId`
//! space, because a pipe id *was* the authority: mode 0 handed the caller a
//! reader of somebody else's stream, mode 1 a writer into it, and
//! `SYS_SOCKET_CREATE` was the same reach under another name. That family is
//! retired and a pipe end travels as a handle.
//!
//! The property that replaced it is stronger. **A handle is a slot in one
//! process's own table**, so a number lifted out of a sibling's output resolves
//! to this process's slot or to nothing at all — and the attack the old shape
//! describes is not expressible rather than refused.
//!
//! **The sweep cannot survive the fail-fast flip, and what replaces it says
//! more.** Naming a handle a process does not hold is a bug in that process, so
//! the first miss of a 4,000-slot sweep is where the sweeping process ends;
//! there is no run of `NotFound`s to count any more. So each way of naming the
//! victim's ends is a child of its own, and beside them is a child that names a
//! slot *nobody* published — the two die identically, which is the whole claim:
//! the victim's number is not refused here, it is not distinguishable from a
//! number that never meant anything.
//!
//! The victim is what stops all of that being vacuous. It holds a live pipe at
//! the numbers it published for as long as the attacks run, and afterwards
//! reads its own end: nothing the attackers wrote arrived, and its own bytes
//! still cross.
