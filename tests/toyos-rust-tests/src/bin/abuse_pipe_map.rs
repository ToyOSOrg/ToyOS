//! A `SYS_PIPE_MAP` window must not outlive the descriptors that justified it.
//!
//! Three syscalls: `SYS_PIPE`, `SYS_PIPE_MAP` on either end, then close both.
//! The last `PipeReader`/`PipeWriter` drop takes the refcount to zero,
//! `free_pipe` drops the `PhysPage`, and the PMM has the 2 MiB page back —
//! while the caller's mapping of it is still live and still writable. Whatever
//! the PMM hands that page to next, another process's pipe or a kernel heap
//! region or a DMA buffer, was then readable and writable by a process that
//! owned nothing.
//!
//! Run as `abuse_pipe_map child`, this binary is the attack: it maps, closes,
//! and writes. The child has to die for this test to pass — a child that
//! reaches its last line has just written into memory it does not own, and
//! says so.
