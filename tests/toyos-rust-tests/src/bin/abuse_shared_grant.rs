//! A region is reachable by the process that was **sent** it, and by nobody
//! else.
//!
//! This test used to be about `shared_memory::grant`'s ACL: the list accepted
//! the owner *or anyone already on it*, so permission was transitive and
//! unreported, and the target pid was unchecked so the list would take pids
//! that had never existed. None of that has a spelling any more — a region is a
//! handle, holding one is the whole of being allowed to map it, and giving one
//! away is `SYS_HANDLE_SEND` over a connection the giver already holds.
//!
//! So the subject moves to what replaced it. The negative arm is the one the
//! ACL could never state: a process that was sent nothing cannot reach the
//! region **by any number at all**, including the exact handle value its owner
//! is using — and it does not merely fail to, it is ended for trying, because
//! naming a handle you were not given is a bug rather than a request. The
//! positive arm is what makes that non-vacuous: the same region, reached by the
//! peer that was sent it, with the secret in it.
//!
//! Three roles. `invited` is spawned holding a connector and is sent the
//! region; `uninvited` is spawned holding nothing and told the owner's handle
//! value; `dropped` is the other end of the same fact — a region whose last
//! handle is gone leaves a number that is not a name for what lands there next.
