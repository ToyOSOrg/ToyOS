//! contents — an information disclosure through `open`, `rm` and `cp`, with
//! nothing crafted about it and no privilege needed.
//!
//! Staged here rather than reasoned about: the victim's blocks are freed and
//! then deliberately handed to a file whose bytes are nothing like the
//! victim's, and the still-open descriptor is read afterwards.
