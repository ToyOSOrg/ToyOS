//! The service another process serves is not reachable by naming it.
//!
//! The original defect: `Descriptor::Listener` carried the service *name*, and
//! accept, close and poll all re-resolved that string through a global
//! registry. The attack was `listen(name)`, `dup`, `close(original)` — the
//! close unregistered the name and left the dup naming nothing, so when the
//! real service claimed the freed name its own `listen` succeeded, and from
//! that moment the stale handle resolved to *its* listener: `accept` on it took the
//! service's connections and `close` on it unregistered the service. Giving the
//! descriptor a `ListenerId` made a stale handle name nothing forever, and left the
//! squat itself — any process could take any name first.
//!
//! **The whole setup is gone.** There is no registry, no `listen` and no name a
//! process can present: a service is a port, its two ends are two types, and a
//! client is given a `Connector` inside a namespace its parent built. So the
//! squat is not something to detect at run time — it is not something that can
//! be written — and what is left to check is the boundary the type system draws
//! and the kernel enforces underneath it.
//!
//! Four arms, each the runtime half of a thing the compiler already refuses to
//! spell. **They no longer answer the same way, and the split is the design.**
//! An attenuated handle is a thing a process may legitimately probe, so arms 1,
//! 2 and 4 come back as words; naming a handle from somebody else's table is a
//! bug no correct program has, so arm 3 ends the caller and is raised in a child
//! that prints a marker first.
//!
//! 1. **A connector cannot accept.** `Connector` has no `accept` method, and
//!    the handle behind one carries no `READ` — so `SYS_ACCEPT` refuses it with
//!    a word before it ever looks at the type.
//! 2. **An acceptor cannot be put in a namespace as a connector.** Two types,
//!    one wire word, and the kernel checks the type rather than trusting it.
//!    **It answers `InvalidArgument` rather than ending the caller, and it is
//!    the only wrong-typed handle in the ABI that does**: an `add` entry's
//!    connector is routinely one a *peer* transferred — a `provides` name is
//!    exactly that — so presenting the wrong one may be reporting a peer's bug
//!    rather than your own. `/system/bin/init`'s launcher is why, and
//!    `launcher_refusals` is the other end of the same property.
//! 3. **A handle number from another process's table names nothing here.** The
//!    victim prints the raw number of a live acceptor of its own; the thief
//!    presenting it is ended, and the victim's port is still serving afterwards.
//! 4. **A name a namespace does not carry resolves to nothing** — and that is
//!    `NotFound`, which is a different word from a port that has closed.
