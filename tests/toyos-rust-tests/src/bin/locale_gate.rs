//! The in-guest half of the layout and wizard gates, as a surface.
//!
//! This program is a **surface owner**, built out of exactly the pieces
//! `/bin/terminal` and `/bin/console` are: it holds the keyboard claim and one
//! `Translator`, makes a port of its own and serves `toyos::surface::Host` on
//! it, and puts that port's connector in the namespace of the child it spawns.
//! What it does not have is a screen — so
//! every assertion the host makes reads a console line instead of a pixel,
//! which is why the layout and wizard gates run here and not against
//! `/bin/console`.
//!
//! One binary rather than two: each is ~1.8 MiB of statically linked std, and
//! ROOT goes into a partition sized from its contents. Modes are
//! `run test_rs_locale_gate <mode>`, which the test runner has always
//! supported.
//!
//! In RUST_SKIP: every mode waits to be typed at through QMP, so on its own
//! nothing ever answers it.
//!
//! - `layout` — run the real `locale swiss-german`, which writes the config
//!   and tells this surface it moved, then print what every key types. Driven
//!   by `swiss_german_layout`.
//! - `detect` — run `locale detect` and relay its conversation while the
//!   wizard holds this surface's keys. **The keyboard is claimed here**, which
//!   is the shape the compositor and `/bin/console` put it in and the shape
//!   that used to make the wizard refuse. Driven by `locale_detect` and
//!   `locale_detect_unrecognized`.
