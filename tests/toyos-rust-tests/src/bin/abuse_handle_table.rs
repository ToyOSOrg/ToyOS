//! The handle-table cap must hold on every insertion path.
//!
//! There are three of them — plain open, `dup2` and `SYS_SPAWN`'s slot map — and
//! a table that grows past the cap on any one reaches a hashbrown doubling
//! above the kernel's 2 MiB single-allocation ceiling.
//!
//! The cap **is** the slot range now: a `RawHandle` carries twelve bits of
//! slot, so "the table is full" and "that slot does not exist" are one event
//! and one error word rather than two that could disagree.
//!
//! **`SYS_SPAWN`'s two vectors are bounded by their own counts as well, and
//! the cap cannot stand in for either.** A slot map that names one slot over
//! and over never trips the cap — the child's table stays one entry wide — and
//! an endowment vector that names one handle twice passes a preflight run
//! against a table nothing has been taken out of yet. Both were reachable with
//! one argument and both ended in the kernel rather than in an error word, so
//! each has an arm here and the last arm is what says the machine survived
//! them.
