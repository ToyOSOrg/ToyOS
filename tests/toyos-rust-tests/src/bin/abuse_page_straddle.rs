//! A translation answers for one 2 MiB page. The typed syscall arguments are
//! read and written through exactly one of them, and ten of the twelve
//! `UserSafe` types are longer than their alignment — so a value placed near
//! the end of a page had its tail read or written *past the physical page*, in
//! whatever the PMM had handed out next.
//!
//! Two are reachable from userland: `fstat`'s 24-byte `Stat`, a kernel write,
//! and `spawn`'s 80-byte `SpawnArgs`, a kernel read whose `argv_ptr` and
//! `argv_len` the kernel then acts on.
//!
//! **The verdict is not the assertion.** The canary is the sixteen bytes on the
//! far side of the boundary: this process owns both pages, and mmap gives it
//! them contiguously, so the bytes the kernel would have written past the end
//! of the first physical page are bytes this process can read back.
