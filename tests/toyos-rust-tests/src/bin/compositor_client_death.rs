//! The desktop must survive a client that dies, and one that asks for
//! something the kernel will refuse on its behalf.
//!
//! The owner's machine lost its whole desktop to this: doom aborted, and three
//! seconds later the compositor granted a resized window's buffer to it —
//! `grant_shared` answered `InvalidArgument` for a pid the process table no
//! longer had, `SharedMemory::grant` was infallible over that, and every other
//! window went with it. `exit: compositor code=101`. There is no grant left to
//! be infallible over: a buffer travels as a handle and a client that has gone
//! is a refused send.
//!
//! Six cases. The first is that one; the next four are the same shape found
//! by reading for it — places where a message from any client reached a
//! syscall or a buffer whose refusal the compositor was not prepared to hear.
//!
//! The fifth is the other side of the same event, and it is the client's:
//! **a window whose connection has gone must let its owner leave.** Nothing
//! else here is about the client's own fate, and that is why it belongs beside
//! them rather than in a test of its own — a window ending has two halves, and
//! each one used to take a process with it.
//!
//! Each case leaves its damage standing and then asks the compositor a
//! question **with a deadline**, exactly as `compositor_stall` does — the host
//! asserts the other half, that the desktop is still painting and that every
//! client dropped on the way was named with its pid.
