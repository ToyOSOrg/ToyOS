//! The park class nothing else exercises: waiting for a child, and joining a
//! thread, under volume.
//!
//! The one park site collapses P7 (child exit) and P8 (thread exit) onto
//! parks on the process object and on the thread's own watch, and **no other
//! gate reaches either**: `blocking_read_stress` is pipes, `cancel_while_parked`
//! and `killed_holder_releases` are disk and VFS. The tree's existing coverage is
//! ordering rather than volume — `process_lifecycle` has one arm on the wake
//! and `std_threading` joins four threads.
//!
//! **The verdict is a count of collected exit codes inside a bound**, the same
//! shape `blocking_read_stress` takes and for the same reason: a lost publish
//! must red as a number rather than as a stall the suite names apart and
//! nobody bisects.
//!
//! Every child is this binary with an argument, so what the parent waits for is
//! a real process exit and not a stub.
