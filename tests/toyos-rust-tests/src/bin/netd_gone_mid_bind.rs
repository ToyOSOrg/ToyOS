//! A netd that goes away *while* a client is binding is still a netd that is
//! not there.
//!
//! `/bin/sshd` has one clean exit for a machine with no network and it is keyed
//! on an error kind: `ErrorKind::NotConnected`, which is what
//! `NetError::NetdNotFound` becomes. Anything else panics, by design — a
//! machine that *has* a NIC and cannot bind must be loud. On a NIC-less machine
//! netd prints its line and exits, and whether sshd took the quiet arm or put a
//! tokio backtrace across the boot depended on which side of netd's teardown
//! its bind landed. Four recorded sightings, on the dev host and on CI alike,
//! and the victim was `boot_partition_identity` every time — a test that
//! refuses any boot whose console carries `panicked at`, so its own subject
//! was untouched and the red named the workload rather than the cause.
//!
//! **The race is not staged here. The sequence is.** What made the defect hard
//! to see is that it is a handful of instructions wide in a real boot; what
//! makes it testable is that nothing about it is actually timing-dependent once
//! the two events are ordered by hand. A port is a port, so this holds one of
//! its own and closes it at a chosen instant, with no netd, no NIC and no
//! clock anywhere.
//!
//! Three arms, and they are three different syscalls answering the same fact:
//!
//! 1. **Gone before the connect.** The port closes first, so
//!    `SYS_NAMESPACE_OPEN` refuses — `SyscallError::Gone`. This is the arm that
//!    already worked, and it is asserted through `std::net::TcpListener` as
//!    well as through the SDK, because `ErrorKind::NotConnected` is the literal
//!    thing `/bin/sshd` matches on.
//! 2. **Gone between the connect and the handle transfer.** The client is
//!    connected and queued when the port closes. `tcp_bind` hands netd a pipe
//!    end, and a request that carries handles moves them *before* it writes the
//!    frame — so `SYS_HANDLE_SEND` is the first thing it can be refused at, and
//!    it answers `SyscallError::Gone`.
//! 3. **The same, for a request that carries no handles**, which reaches the
//!    frame write instead, where a pipe with no reader is the same
//!    `SyscallError::Gone`.
//!
//! Arms 2 and 3 are the ones that produced the panic. They are red on a tree
//! where `toyos::net::hangup` maps anything but `IpcError::Disconnected` to
//! `NetError::Io`, which is `ErrorKind::Other`, which is sshd's `panic!`.
//!
//! **Nothing here waits.** The child's ordering edge is a *second* connection
//! to the same port, read with a blocking read: `Acceptor::on_zero_handles`
//! closes every queued connection's inbox and only then drops the connections,
//! so a read that answers `0` on one of them proves the other one's outbox is
//! already closed. The hook is deferred to a drain site
//! (`kernel/src/object/mod.rs`'s `ZERO_QUEUE`), so a sleep would be a guess and
//! this is not one.
