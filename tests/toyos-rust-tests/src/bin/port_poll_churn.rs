//! The window a Ring 0 fetch at address zero was once blamed on: the last
//! `Acceptor` handle going while an `io_uring` poll still references the port.
//! The fault turned out to be the direction-flag class and not this window —
//! the port code was audited sound — and the churn stays because the window is
//! real whatever first pointed at it.
//!
//! The acceptor handle and the ring go away in both orders here, from two
//! threads at once, because the fault this was written for was seen once in a
//! boot with two of them live and has never been seen alone.
//!
//! It is a churn test, not a property test: every arm asserts what it can, but
//! what it is really watching for is a kernel that stops.
