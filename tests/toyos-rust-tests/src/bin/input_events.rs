//! Claims both input devices and prints every event either one produces.
//!
//! Driven by `metal_sim_input` and `xhci_second_controller`, which inject
//! through QMP one step at a time and wait for these lines between steps — so
//! the host never has more in flight than the guest has taken. The line formats
//! are the ones `i8042_keyboard` and `i8042_mouse` already print, so the host
//! parses them with the same two functions. Not a standalone test: on its own
//! it would report nothing, which is why it is in RUST_SKIP.
