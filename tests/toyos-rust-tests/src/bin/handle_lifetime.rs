//! What a handle holds is released when the *last* handle goes, and no sooner —
//! on `close` and on being killed alike.
//!
//! Duplicating a handle used to copy a `ListenerId` and a `RingId` as bare
//! numbers while `close` unregistered the service and destroyed the ring
//! unconditionally, so `dup` and then closing either handle took the object out
//! from under the survivor. A file was already refcounted; it is here because
//! the kinds are one property, and a test covering three of them says nothing
//! about the fourth.
//!
//! **The service half is now a port**, and its witness is better for it: there
//! is no name to ask about, so what says the acceptor is alive is that a client
//! connecting through the connector is accepted, and what says it is gone is
//! that the next open answers [`SyscallError::Gone`] — the kernel's own record
//! of a server that has left, rather than a name nobody re-took.
//!
//! The kill half is why this is a guest test and not a host one. This kernel
//! does not unwind, so a `Drop` reached only by an orderly `close` would be
//! decoration: `kill` runs on another CPU and drains the victim's handle
//! table itself, and that is the path each case below re-checks.
//!
//! Roles: no argument is the test; `holder <kind>` takes one object, reports
//! what it can about it, and waits to be killed.
