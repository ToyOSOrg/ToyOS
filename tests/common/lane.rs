//! One scratch directory per thread that boots guests.
//!
//! Every scratch file in this harness is named for what it is — `esp-boot.img`,
//! `usb-gate-512.img`, the size-keyed NVMe image `boot_with_options` makes — and
//! not for the boot that uses it, because until the suite ran serially there was
//! only ever one boot. Two guests handed one path is the defect that killed the
//! first consolidation
//! attempt, and it is not a defect a per-file fix closes: the next test to add a
//! staged image gets the shared directory by default and nothing says otherwise.
//!
//! So the *directory* carries the answer. A worker enters its lane once and
//! every path derived from [`dir`] afterwards is that worker's alone, including
//! ones written after this was.
//!
//! A lane is not a place state carries between tests: the NVMe scratch image is
//! remade blank for every boot that names none (`QemuInstance::boot_with_options`),
//! so no test can depend on, or be broken by, whichever test ran before it.
