///
/// **The wall clock is not the wedge; silence is.** A test's `ceiling` is the
/// budgeted wall clock (`budget_smp`-scaled, so it already carries #256's
/// `vcpus/cores` oversubscription widening), and until this it ended the wait
/// the instant it passed — so a merely-slow guest reported exactly what a wedged
/// one did. `launcher_refusals` was killed at `192s "still talking 1s ago"` on a
/// loaded `smp:2` runner its `vcpus/cores` factor clamps to 1, a guest making
/// steady progress called wedged by a clock. So a guest still *talking* is now
/// never ended by `ceiling`: the per-test budget bites only a guest that has
/// *also* gone quiet for [`GUEST_QUIET`], and a talking one runs to the
/// [`GUEST_WEDGED`] backstop below.

/// idle soundd, and the kernel's own ~10 s line halting with the idle loop — was
/// measured quiet for as long as 102 s, so a guard that fired on 15 s of silence
