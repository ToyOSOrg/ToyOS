//! The kernel's interrupt census, read back on the host.
//!
//! The guest prints `irq: cpuN total=… timer=… …` per online CPU whenever a
//! process exits, on `SYS_SHUTDOWN` and on the blocked-task dump
//! (`kernel/src/irq_census.rs`). The counters are cumulative since boot, so the
//! **last** line a capture holds for a CPU is that boot's whole census.
//!
//! Two readers, and they are why this is a module rather than a closure:
//! `irq_census_conservation` asks whether one boot's census is internally
//! consistent, and the suite's own summary asks where the machine's interrupts
//! landed across every guest a run booted. The second is the instrument the
//! `every-interrupt-lands-on-the-boot-cpu` track's later change is measured
//! against, so it has to be produced by an ordinary run rather than by
//! `--nocapture`: CI's `guest` shards do not pass that flag, and a number only a
//! developer's terminal can produce is not a baseline.
