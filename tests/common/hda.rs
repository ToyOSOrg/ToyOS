/// is a cyclic ring — it plays buffer `i` again `num_buffers` periods after
/// completing it, whatever soundd put there — so a period held back for a

/// is a completion for a buffer soundd still holds. virtio-sound's queue plays
/// nothing soundd has not submitted, so holding one costs nothing and the
/// deferral is exactly right there.
///
/// So: the ring arm must report `underruns` (soundd filled the periods and had
/// no client audio for them) and the queue arm must report `deferred` (soundd
/// held them). Asserting both is what stops the two obvious wrong fixes —
/// deleting the deferral, which reds the queue arm, and letting the ring hold a
/// period, which reds the ring arm with the panic this exists for.
///
/// Nothing in the tone clients reaches this state: they keep their rings full,
/// so `hda_tone` measured `deferred=0` on every run. The stall is the actuator,
/// and it has to outlast one lap of the ring — 8 periods, 23.2 ms — or the
/// engine never comes back round to a period soundd is holding.
