//! The harness half of the scheduler's pass-cost instrument: read the check
//! build's published distribution and judge it against **what this accelerator
//! has been recorded producing**, not against an absolute line.
//!
//! **Why the judgement is here and not in the kernel.** A pass is measured with
//! the only clock either world has across one — wall clock, `rdtsc` in the
//! kernel — and a guest's wall clock advances while the host has taken its vCPU
//! away. The elapsed time of a pass is therefore a *composed* quantity: the
//! scheduler's own work plus an interval the host's scheduler sets, which this
//! CPU neither observes nor controls and which no constant bounds. A panic may
//! assert only what its own site observes and what no workload scales, so the
//! kernel records the distribution ([`toyos_sched::cpu::PassCostReport`]) and
//! this file decides what it means.
//!
//! **What that costs, stated rather than implied.** A single pass that really
//! ran long and a single pass whose CPU was descheduled are the same sample,
//! and nothing — here or in the kernel — can separate them. So the maximum is
//! printed and never gated, and a rare long pass is reported rather than
//! caught. That is the honest limit of this instrument and it has not changed.
//!
//! # Why `MAX_PASS_NS` is not the line any more
//!
//! This gate used to read the budget directly: nine passes in ten provably
//! under 200 000 ns. Its argument was that a host which deschedules a vCPU
//! touches the handful of passes it lands in, so it moves the maximum and not
//! the 90th percentile — *mass is the scheduler, extremes are the machine*.
//! That argument was an observed rate rather than a bound, and it was put to
//! the experiment on 2026-08-18.
//!
//! **It is false.** Six repetitions per arm, quiet and loaded, strictly
//! interleaved in one session so both arms share the ambient host; twelve
//! CPU-runs per arm at `smp: 2`. The load was fourteen pure-shell spin loops,
//! one per logical CPU (`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` answers 14 on the dev host),
//! measured standing alone at 90.0–94.9 % CPU each and taking the 1-minute load
//! average from 9.45 to 28.02. The arms separate on the harness's own boot-width
//! instrument with no overlap: 1.74x–2.34x quiet against 2.66x–2.78x loaded.
//!
//! | | quiet, 12 CPU-runs | loaded, 12 CPU-runs |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | p50 | 8 192 ×1, 16 384 ×1, 65 536 ×10 | 8 192 ×1, 32 768 ×1, 131 072 ×10 |
//! | p90 | 65 536 ×2, 131 072 ×10 | 131 072 ×3, 262 144 ×9 |
//! | max | 1 508 330 – 1 983 355 ns | 1 723 825 – 3 914 718 ns |
//! | over budget | 95 of 2 732 (3.48 %) | 187 of 2 619 (7.14 %) |
//! | p90 over budget | **0 of 12** | **9 of 12** |
//!
//! **The whole distribution translates up by one power-of-two bucket under host
//! load, and 200 000 ns sits between the quiet p90 and the loaded one** — which
//! is the entirety of why the verdict flips. Every order statistic moved, the
//! median as much as the tail, so no fraction chosen instead of nine-in-ten
//! would have survived either. There is no quantile of this quantity that host
//! load leaves alone.
//!
//! # What replaces it: the recorded sample of the accelerator in hand
//!
//! The same session recovered the other half. This file's line has printed on
//! every run whatever the verdict, so CI's own logs already held a KVM sample —
//! sixteen `ci` runs, 32 CPU-runs, 7 612 passes, **not one of them over the
//! budget**, p90 at 32 768 ns and the largest single pass in the whole set
//! 173 906 ns. The two accelerators are not one instrument: p90 differs by four
//! between KVM and a *quiet* dev host and by eight against a loaded one, and the
//! maxima by twenty. An absolute line cannot be right for both, and 200 000 ns
//! is right for neither — six times looser than anything KVM produces, and
//! inside the range host load alone sweeps on TCG.
//!
//! So a run is judged against its own accelerator's recorded sample
//! ([`KVM`], [`TCG`]) — the shape `tests/audio-baseline.toml` uses, made
//! environment-relative, which needs no separation of steal from work at all.
//! **And where a recorded sample cannot support a verdict it says so and does
//! not take one**: TCG's own sample spans four buckets on one unchanged tree,
//! so no line drawn from it would be a statement about the scheduler. That is
//! `tests/CLAUDE.md`'s standing rule for this host — what only CI's KVM shards
//! can decide is decided there — applied to a cost rather than to a vendor.
//!
//! **What was not done, so nobody re-derives it.** Reading KVM's paravirtual
//! steal-time MSR would let the guest gate a quantity it observes rather than
//! one it infers, and it is closed by owner ruling: a hypervisor-specific
//! facility cannot be the basis of a gate in a tree whose north star is
//! self-hosting on metal. Steal accounting may be a diagnostic and never a gate.
