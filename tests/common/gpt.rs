//! The boot partition, end to end: firmware, the ABI, and a real block driver.
//!
//! The parser's own reasoning is host-tested inside `toyos-gpt/`, over crafted
//! tables and every hostile field, and none of that needs a guest. What only a
//! guest can answer is whether the *identity* survives the trip — OVMF's
//! device path, the bootloader, `KernelArgs`, the kernel's NVMe driver — and
//! whether the parser finds that identity on a table it did not author.
//!
//! Ground truth is the disk image, read on the host by the `gpt` crate, which
//! is a different implementation from the one under test. The guest's own
//! account of the partition it booted from is exactly what is in question, so
//! it cannot also be the reference.
//!
//! The table on the NVMe disk is built to be adversarial in the two ways that
//! matter. Its *first* entry is an ESP by type — so a matcher keying on the
//! type GUID, or taking the first partition, or taking the first ESP, gets a
//! different span than the one asserted. And the second boot moves the
//! matching entry by eight blocks, so a kernel that skips the firmware-versus-
//! table agreement check accepts a partition that is not where firmware said
//! it was.
