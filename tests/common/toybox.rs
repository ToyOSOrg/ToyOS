//! `cp` and `mv` against a real volume, judged on the disk image the device
//! received rather than on what the guest said it did.
//!
//! Two questions, one boot, one volume, because the second needs the first to
//! have already spent the space:
//!
//! 1. **A copy is byte-exact on the device.** The source is staged by the host
//!    before the machine exists, so a guest that read back its own writes
//!    cannot pass — and it is several times `cp`'s flush interval, so the copy
//!    reaches the device in a series of flushes rather than one.
//! 2. **A copy that runs out of volume refuses, and leaves nothing.** The
//!    volume is filled here to a hair over one copy's worth of free space, so
//!    the first `cp` succeeds and the second cannot. What the second must leave
//!    behind is *nothing*: no file under the destination's name, no `.part`
//!    sibling, and nothing new for the volume checker to say — a half-allocated
//!    cluster chain is what a "did the command exit non-zero" check cannot see.
//!
//! The log partition and not the ESP, which is where this started. Measured on
//! a freshly built test image: the ESP has **167 free clusters, 85,504 bytes**.
//! `create_esp_volume` sizes it at `content + 4 MiB`, and at that volume size
//! FAT32 uses 512-byte clusters, so the two FATs describing half a million of
//! them eat the whole four megabytes of slack. Nothing large can be written to
//! `/boot` at runtime; the log partition is the only writable FAT32 volume on
//! the stick with room, and it starts with 33 MiB free.
//!
//! Which means sharing with `/system/bin/logd`. [`LEAVE_FREE`] is set so that after the
//! copy that succeeds there are still about two megabytes for this boot's log —
//! a boot's log is a few tens of kilobytes, and logd stops and says so if a
//! write ever fails, so a squeeze here would be visible rather
//! than silent.
