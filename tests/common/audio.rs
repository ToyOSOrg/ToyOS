//! Wav capture parsing and glitch analysis for the audio integration tests.
//!
//! The QEMU wav audiodev records a continuous timeline of what the
//! virtio-sound device played. Underruns show up as stretches of digital
//! silence inside an otherwise active signal; clicks show up as
//! sample-to-sample jumps no band-limited signal could produce.
//!
//! The capture timeline is NOT wall clock. QEMU's wav backend writes only
//! while the guest voice is enabled, so the file freezes across every
//! suspended stretch and splices the next resume directly
//! onto the last stopped sample. Verified empirically: 25s of wall clock with
//! the stream stopped adds zero PCM bytes. Consequence: `analyze` reports an
//! underrun for ANY two signal regions in one capture, at ANY wall-clock gap
//! between them — the spliced silence (drain tail + resume prime) always
//! exceeds `MIN_GAP_SECS`, and `NEAR_SECS` is a proximity window into
//! adjacent *samples*, not wall time, so it can never exonerate the gap. A
//! test that plays two tones in one boot will always go red against a
//! zero-gap baseline; keep one signal region per capture.

/// Gate: doom's sound producer outruns its audio callback and the game lives.
///
/// The T14 report this exists for: about five seconds into playing doom the
/// machine froze, and the first thing to go was doom itself —
/// `sound command ring overflow: audio callback stalled` inside
/// `I_UpdateSoundParams`, an `extern "C"` frame with no unwind path, so the
/// panic became `abort`. The kernel then panicked retiring the task and the
/// compositor died granting shared memory to a pid that was no longer there.
/// This is the first domino.
///
/// Nothing in the flood is timed. The actuator parks the audio callback with
/// `cpal::Stream::pause` and requires the callback's own period counter to
/// stand still across the burst, so "the producer outran the consumer" is a
/// fact about the two of them rather than about how busy this host was — a
/// distinction the harness owes the suspended-laptop case, where a wall-clock
/// burst is satisfied by stopping both sides at once.
///
/// Four assertions, three of them in-guest facts the host reads back and one
/// on the wire:
///
/// 1. **The game lives.** `/bin/doom --sound-stress` exits 0. On the tree this
///    replaced the same burst aborts on its 65th command.
/// 2. **The burst was real.** `stalled_burst` commands were issued with the
///    callback's period count unchanged — 4096 of them, 64x the retired ring.
/// 3. **The callback converged, and did so at the audio rate.** The sound the
///    last command started plays to completion, and the periods that took
///    match its length: a mixer that lost the command never finishes, and one
///    that restarted it takes longer.
/// 4. **The last command is what reached the device.** Every superseded update
///    in the burst carries `QUIET_VOLUME`, which mixes to 251 LSB — under
///    `SIGNAL_THRESHOLD`, so it is not signal. The final one carries full
///    volume, 16000 * 127/255 = 7968. A capture with signal in it is a capture
///    in which the last write won.
