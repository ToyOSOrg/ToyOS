//! The console's line atomicity, and the one thing the harness may conclude
//! from it.
//!
//! Two subjects, in this order because the second rests on the first:
//!
//! 1. [`console_line_atomicity`] — every line on the console is one writer's,
//!    whole.
//! 2. [`verdict`] — therefore a line's *first bytes are its writer's own*, so
//!    the C family can tell a daemon's line from the program under test's by
//!    reading it, and stop failing on output that is not its own.
//!
//! The order is the argument, and it is the whole of what closed task #84.
//! Before L5 a daemon's `println!` and a test's could reach the backend in
//! pieces and arrive spliced into one line, and no rule over lines could
//! separate them — so the standing write-up said there was no cheap honest fix
//! and left a choice between giving each child a capture channel and tagging
//! every console write with its writer. L5 built neither and made a third
//! answer sound: a console *is* a per-holder line buffer now, so a line begins
//! with its writer's first bytes or `console_line_atomicity` is red.
//!
//! **L5's guarantee is about flushes, not about newlines, and that is the
//! second half.** A program that writes without a trailing newline has its
//! bytes joined to the next writer's line by the *host's* splitter — see
//! [`speaker_at`], which is where that is written down. Both halves are
//! [`c_capture_ignores_daemon_lines`]'s, and every one of its verdicts carries
//! the control that says it has teeth.
