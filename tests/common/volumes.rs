//! The boot stick's two partitions, mounted and written from inside ToyOS.
//!
//! The ESP holds what firmware and the bootloader read. The log partition
//! beside it holds the kernel's own log and exists for one reason: it is typed
//! so that a desktop OS mounts it on plug-in, which an EFI-typed partition is
//! not. Both are FAT32 and neither is found by being FAT32 — the kernel is
//! handed both by unique GUID, and `log_partition_identity` is the gate that
//! says so by moving the name and watching the mount disappear.
//!
//! Ground truth is the disk image the *device* received, read on the host by
//! implementations that are not the kernel's: the `fatfs` crate and
//! `toyos-fat32-check`. The guest's account of a write it made is exactly what
//! is in question, so it cannot also be the evidence; `esp_files` asserts what
//! only a process inside the machine can see, and everything it claims about
//! bytes is checked again here.
//!
//! **Where this stops.** `log_partition_layout` pins the image: type GUID,
//! attribute bits, labels, alignment, and that our own GPT parser finds the
//! partition the ESP names. It does not assert that any operating system
//! *mounts* it. Whether macOS attaches a Basic Data partition is
//! `diskarbitrationd`'s policy, not our contract — it moves between macOS
//! versions and host settings, it would put a volume on the owner's desktop
//! every test run, and it would race concurrent runs. That end of the contract
//! was verified once by hand, on 2026-08-02, and is re-verified when a stick is
//! flashed.
//!
//! The image is built and modified before the boot rather than after, because
//! the host-writes-guest-reads direction has no other staging point: a file the
//! guest itself created and read back would pass with the read path broken.

///   no earlier run can have.
/// - **A single write when the file was opened.** logd creates its file early,
///   so a logd that then did nothing would still produce one. `Boot: complete`
///   is logged after that, so requiring it requires a write after the open.
/// - **The shutdown path standing in for the continuous one.** The mid-run read
///   happens before `run shutdown` and must already have `Boot: complete`; the
///   post-shutdown read must additionally have the shutdown's own last line,
///   which only §6.3's bounded wait on `LOG_DURABLE_NS` can deliver.
///
/// A second boot, from `tests/logrotatecase`, drives the bound: rotation is
/// what stops the file filling the owner's stick, and at the shipped mebibyte
