//! Telling a suspended host from a slow one.
//!
//! The dev machine is a laptop and the owner closes the lid. A run that spans
//! that is not a slow run, it is an **invalid measurement**: QEMU's virtual
//! clock, the guest's own millisecond stamps and every device timing in it jump
//! by however long the machine was away, and every wall-clock verdict in the
//! serial tail and in gate A is taken against one of those. CLAUDE.md already
//! documents the signature — a tight cluster of durations plus a few enormous
//! outliers — and documents it as something an agent must check *before*
//! recording a finding, which is to say the harness has never been able to.
//!
//! It can, and with no new source of truth: the two clocks the harness already
//! reads disagree by exactly the suspended time.
//!
//! - `Instant` is `CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW` on this platform and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on
//!   Linux. Neither advances while the machine is asleep — the first by its
//!   documented definition, which `library/std/src/sys/time/unix.rs` quotes in
//!   full beside the constant.
//! - `SystemTime` is the wall clock and does.
//!
//! So `wall − monotonic` over an interval **is** the time the host spent
//! stopped, and every deadline the suite takes is on the monotonic one — which
//! is why a suspended run does not report a timeout. It reports whatever the
//! guest made of two hours in the middle, and calls it a defect.
