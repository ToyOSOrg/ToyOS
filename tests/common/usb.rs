//! The USB mass-storage gate.
//!
//! Ground truth is the backing file on the *host*: the harness writes bytes
//! into the image
//! before the boot and the guest has to find them, and the guest writes bytes
//! the harness finds afterwards. Neither half of the driver certifies the
//! other, which a read-back-what-you-wrote test would have let it do.
//!
//! Lives here rather than in `toyos.rs` so the registration hunk in that shared
//! file stays two lines: every agent edits it, and a wide diff there is how
