//! What the kernel's HDA stub hands its driver.
//!
//! The line through the device is **who touches a register**: the kernel
//! programs every register whose value is an address or indexes a structure it
//! allocated, and the driver reaches the rest through
//! [`syscall::device_reg_read`] and [`syscall::device_reg_write`], each checked
//! against an allow-list and refused by name. Nothing here names a physical
//! address.
//!
//! [`RegWidth`](crate::syscall::RegWidth) is those calls' and not this device's,
//! since virtio-sound's stub reaches its notification registers the same way.
//!
//! Completions come back as [`AudioCompletionRecord`](crate::audio::AudioCompletionRecord),
//! the same record the virtio-sound stub produces, because the mask is derived
//! from a position read in the interrupt handler and the two backends then
//! differ in nothing a mixer can see.
//!
//! [`syscall::device_reg_read`]: crate::syscall::device_reg_read
//! [`syscall::device_reg_write`]: crate::syscall::device_reg_write
