//! The kernel ABI: struct layouts, syscall numbers, and the typed wrappers over
//! them. Completely unstable — userland reaches it through `toyos`, and the
//! kernel is the only other side.
//!
//! **A doc in this crate states what the ABI itself owns, and cites the
//! component by path for everything else.** A sentence asserting how the kernel
//! dispatches a call, or what another component keeps internally, is a claim
//! nothing here checks and somebody else's landing falsifies. A citation that
//! goes stale is a dead pointer — visible, and greppable; an assertion that
//! goes stale is a lie that still reads authoritative.
