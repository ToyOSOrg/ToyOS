//! One layout, two types over it. The kernel's slot is this struct with its
//! first word made atomic; [`LogRecord`] is what a reader gets, and by the time
//! it holds one that word is just a sequence number. Making it *one* type with
//! an `AtomicU64` in it — which an earlier draft did — makes the copy-out a
//! transmute of an atomic into a value nobody synchronises on, and gives a
//! userland reader a field named `commit` that commits nothing.
//!
//! Nothing here dispatches: the kernel's implementation of [`SYS_LOG_READ`]
//! arrives with the record ring it reads, and until then the number falls to the
//! syscall dispatch's default and answers `InvalidArgument`, which is what an
//! unassigned number answers.
