//! What the kernel's virtio-sound stub hands its driver.
//!
//! The line through this device is the one HDA's is: **the kernel writes every
//! address.** A split virtqueue names memory in exactly one place, its
//! descriptor table, and the three tables here live in a page no process maps.
//! What a driver gets is the region those descriptors point into, the two ring
//! indices that select one of them, and one register write to say it has.
//!
//! So the layout below is the whole interface. It is a set of constants rather
//! than fields of [`VirtioSoundInfo`] because both halves have to agree on it
//! for the descriptors to mean anything, and a number the kernel reports is a
//! number a driver could believe instead of the one the descriptors were built
//! from.
