//! The calendar, and the zone offset a userland reader has to recover.
//!
//! Two things live here because two programs need them and the host is where
//! either can be tested: the kernel decodes an RTC into a [`Civil`] and stamps
//! FAT directory entries from it, and `/system/bin/logd` names one file per boot from
//! the same calendar in the same zone. Before this crate there was one
//! implementation in `kernel/src/clock.rs` that userland could not reach, and
//! the second copy would have been the one whose correctness argument mattered
//! most and whose tests could not run.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates, nothing here is `unsafe`, and nothing here reads a
//! device: it is arithmetic over numbers its callers hand it.
//!
//! # The zone recovery
//!
//! [`resolve`] is the whole of `/log`'s wall-clock question, and [`Recovery`]
//! is its honest answer type. The syscall surface gives userland two readings
//! of one instant — `SYS_CLOCK_EPOCH`, which is UTC seconds, and
//! `SYS_CLOCK_REALTIME`, which is local `h:m:s` and no date — so the offset
//! between the zones is a subtraction of seconds-of-day. That
//! subtraction pins the offset **modulo 24 hours**, and the real range of zone
//! offsets is 26 hours wide (UTC−12:00 to UTC+14:00), so a two-hour band is
//! genuinely ambiguous: the same pair of readings is UTC+13 on one day and
//! UTC−11 on the day before. [`Recovery::Ambiguous`] is that band, named rather
//! than guessed, because the two answers differ by a whole day in a file name.
//! `userland/logd/src/wall.rs` is the caller and carries the argument in full.
