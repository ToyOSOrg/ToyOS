//! Intel HDA codec decoding and output-path selection, as pure functions.
//!
//! Everything a driver has to *decide* before it touches a register: what a
//! codec said about itself, and which converter and pins carry sound to a
//! speaker. No I/O, no register writes, no allocation of device memory — the
//! effects are soundserver's. It is a crate because the graph traversal is what QEMU
//! certifies least: pure, it is host-tested against the committed codec dumps of
//! the machines that have to work, and against states no machine in reach
//! constructs.
//!
//! Every value a codec supplies is untrusted. Counts are bounded, node ids are
//! checked against the range their function group declared, and a connection
//! list that cycles is a refusal rather than a walk.
