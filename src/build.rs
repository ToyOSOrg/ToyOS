//
// So: hold [`buildlock::artifact`] across each build→stage pair, and copy the
// artifact to a name carrying what it is actually keyed by. Readers use the
// staged name, which no other config can overwrite.
//
// The bootloader used to be here for the same reason and no longer is: its init
// list was compiled into it, so the `.efi` was a function of the boot config,
// and an image once carried metalcase's initrd beside another config's
// bootloader whose 28-byte init string was `"/bin/soundd;/bin/test-runner"` —
// the compositor was never spawned and the test failed as though the daemon
// under test were broken. The bootloader carries no config now, so it is
