//! Serialising the build system's stateful phases across the builds running
//! against this repository.
//!
//! Cargo's own build lock cannot do this job. `src/build.rs`'s `invalidate_stale`
//! runs the `clean` that `cargo clean`s a crate's `target/`, and cargo's lock
//! lives inside it at `target/<profile>/.cargo-lock` — the clean deletes the
//! file the other process's lock is on. So these files live outside every
//! directory the build system removes: a lock on an inode that can be unlinked
//! and recreated under a waiter is not a lock.
//!
//! Two modes, because two plain `cargo build`s of different packages are
//! cargo's business and serialising those would destroy the parallelism the
//! builds depend on:
//!
//! - **shared** — "I am building against the toolchain and the crate target
//!   directories as they stand". Any number at once.
//! - **exclusive** — "I am replacing shared build state": the rust bootstrap,
//!   the sysroot writes, the `cargo clean`s. One at a time, and never while a
//!   build holds the shared mode.
//!
//! And two [`Scope`]s, because "shared" stopped meaning one thing once the repo
//! grew worktrees: a crate target directory is shared by the builds in one
//! worktree, while the sysroot is shared by every worktree at once. A lock in
//! the worktree cannot serialise the second, and a lock in the common directory
//! would serialise the first against worktrees that have nothing to do with it.
//!
//! [`integration`] is neither: one file of its own, exclusive-only, and held
//! while this host's `main` moves rather than while anything builds.
//!
//! [`guest_slot`] and [`build_slot`] are not modes of anything — they are
//! counts. The host's cores are spent by intra-suite width and by inter-worktree
//! suites alike, and nothing was handing them out, so a second suite on the
//! machine timed the first one's boots out. A guest slot counts guests; a worker
//! that is *compiling* holds one and is not a guest, which is what
//! [`build_slot`] adds and what twelve simultaneous kernel builds on fourteen
//! cores cost.
//!
//! **The order between all four is a constraint, not a preference:** sysroot →
//! host slot (guest or build) → build lock → artifact. A build slot is taken
//! before any build lock and never while one is held, and after the sysroot lock
//! rather than before it: a `--claim-sysroot` holds the sysroot and then wants a
//! build slot, so the reverse order closes a cycle.
//!
//! Holder death: `flock` is released by the kernel when the open file
//! description closes, so a builder that is SIGKILLed mid-phase — routine here
//! — strands nothing, which a lock file with a pid in it could not promise.
//! Established on this host (Darwin 25.5.0) rather than assumed, and
//! `killed_holder_releases_the_lock` keeps it that way.
