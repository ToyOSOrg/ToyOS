//! Merging what a sharded run measured into the profile the next one reads.
//!
//! A runner is a fresh clone and has no `target/test-durations`, so
//! `longest_first` prices every test the same and `Shard::keep`'s LPT
//! degenerates to round-robin. That put 191 of 268 tests on one shard of run
//! `31238056513` and cut it off at its job timeout while another finished in
//! sixteen minutes. `tests/test-durations` is the answer and it is committed,
//! because the machines that need it are the ones that have run nothing.
//!
//! **Its numbers come from a runner and not from here**, deliberately:
//! cross-arch TCG on an M4 Pro and KVM on four Azure cores do not agree about
//! which tests are long, the dev host overwrites every name it measures with its
//! own, and the file exists for the checkout that has measured nothing.
//!
//! **One profile, one instrument**: `tests/test-durations` holds what twelve
//! GitHub-hosted shards measured, and every event's guest lane is that same
//! twelve-shard shape, so the tier verdict is always rendered on the
//! instrument the profile was taken on.
//!
//! Why a command and not a `cat`: the shards are a *partition*, and that is the
//! property the merged file's usefulness rests on. A repeated name means two
//! shards claimed one test or one shard ran the same label twice — the first is
//! exactly the failure this has already produced: three shards of `nvme_` where
//! one test ran twice and one ran nowhere, and all three reported green. A
//! concatenation cannot see it; this refuses it by name.
//!
//! **A `durations` red is never ignorable on a PR**: the required `guest-suite`
//! check aggregates it, so a red here fails a required check transitively even
//! though `durations` itself is not on the required list. The usual cause is a
//! committed `UNMEASURED` marker past its one bought run — the cure is the
//! measured value from that run's own `test-durations-merged` artifact, never a
//! re-run. Learned on 2026-08-19, when three PRs stalled on exactly this while
//! everyone read the red as stale noise.
//!
//! **Which names decide whether the price verdict is rendered.**
//! The owner's ruling of 2026-08-22: a run measuring a change renders
//! the verdict for the names that change registered or re-tiered, and prints
//! every other one as a `::warning::` naming the name, the price and why this
//! run does not enforce it. The nightly passes no base, so [`Enforced`] is
//! `Everything` there and the full verdict reds — fixed by a pull request the
//! next day like every other nightly red.
//!
//! **A Rust guest test's registration is its file.** `tests/toyos.rs` discovers
//! `tests/toyos-rust-tests/src/bin/<name>.rs` from the binaries it built and no
//! table ever names it, so the scan reads that directory as a source beside the
//! two tables: a file added, deleted or edited there names its stem, by the
//! stem rule the discovery itself applies. Without it a discovered name was
//! invisible to the scan — PR #218 registered `netd_gone_mid_bind` and its
//! `durations` job on run `32568941432` said the verdict was "rendered for no
//! name", and only the committed `UNMEASURED` marker's own refusal, which no
//! base softens, kept that landing red at all.
//!
//! The reason is measured. Over six hosted twelve-shard runs — 72 shard-runs,
//! 640 observations, 130 names — a per-shard common price factor explains 57%
//! of the run-to-run variance a name shows and spreads about 1.28x from p10 to
//! p90; it is *not* the shard's boot width (slope 0.014, R² 0.003 on the
//! merge-queue lane), so nothing normalises it away
//! (`issues/build/a-shards-boot-width-does-not-price-its-tests.md`). A name
//! priced anywhere near a line therefore reads over it on some runs by shard
//! luck, and under the required merge queue that red dequeues the composition —
//! every pull request behind it included, none of whose authors touched the
//! name. `xhci_full_speed_device` is the recorded case: six prices from 4,700
//! to 9,890 ms on one unchanged test, the last of them reding composition
//! 32550410305.
//!
//! Nothing about what a tier *is* moved: `src/tiers.rs`'s ceiling is still hard
//! and unmargined and its rule is unchanged. Nor is the tree's own bookkeeping
//! softened — a committed `UNMEASURED` marker past its bought run, a duplicate
//! execution label, a short shard set, an erased Fast label and every
//! declaration verdict [`crate::tiers::Verdict::priced`] marks `false` red on
//! every run at every base, because none of them is a fact about which shard ran
//! what.
