//! Identifiers a tree may not name, and the exceptions that are named instead.
//!
//! **Clippy runs now, and these scans are what it cannot say.** The `host` job
//! in `.github/workflows/host-tests.yml` runs default clippy with warnings
//! denied over three trees on every pull request — the host workspace
//! (`--workspace --all-targets`), the kernel (`--target x86_64-unknown-none`)
//! and the bootloader (`--target x86_64-unknown-uefi`) — so a `clippy.toml` is
//! no longer a wall with nothing behind it.
//!
//! What is behind it is still not these three scans. `disallowed-methods` could
//! take the first one, and would lose what makes it useful: the exceptions
//! below are per file *and per line count*, so an added `mem::forget` beside a
//! permitted one reds, which a name-based allow list cannot express. The second
//! and third scans ask whether an identifier is absent from the tree, which is
//! not a question any lint asks at all. So the first scan bans, over
//! `kernel/src` and `toyos-sched/src`, the methods that take an object's
//! lifetime out of its `Arc`'s hands — `Arc::into_raw`, `Arc::from_raw`, the
//! two strong-count adjusters — and `mem::forget`. It runs in
//! `cargo test --lib`, on every machine that builds this tree, in milliseconds.
//!
//! The exceptions are per file and per line count, so an *added* `forget`
//! beside a permitted one is a red rather than a silence.
//!
//! The second scan enforces that there is no global registry: a name a process
//! could present and have resolved for it is the thing this architecture
//! deleted, so the registry's identifiers must be gone from the code rather
//! than merely unused. It reads
//! **code only** — comments and string literals are stripped first — because
//! the history of what a name used to mean is worth keeping and the
//! retired-syscall gravestone table names every one of them as a string on
//! purpose.
//!
//! The third runs the same walk over [`RETIRED_ABI_NAMES`]: every syscall,
//! `SYS_DEBUG` action and inbox op code this project has deleted. Its
//! *number* is what is retired, and a number is not a thing a scan can look
//! for — the name that used to carry it is.
