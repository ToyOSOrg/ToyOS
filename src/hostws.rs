//! Who is in the host workspace, and the gate that keeps the answer honest.
//!
//! Every crate in this repository that is tested on the host is a member of the
//! workspace root `Cargo.toml` declares, and CI runs the lot with one
//! `cargo test --workspace --exclude toyos-build`. That is the whole point of
//! the arrangement. Before it, the set of host-tested crates was a list in the
//! workflow *and* a set of standalone workspace roots, and the two drifted
//! three times: four pure crates until 2026-08-08, `toyos-keymap` and
//! `bcachefs` until 2026-08-14, and `toyos-abi` and `toyos-manifest` — 23 tests
//! between them — which reached no workflow at all (the tracker entry closed
//! by the commit that added this file).
//!
//! A third copy of the list would restore the defect, so there is exactly one:
//! the `[workspace]` table. This module is its only reader. [`target_dir`]
//! answers `src/build.rs`'s question about where cargo writes a crate's
//! artifacts — a member's land in the workspace root's `target/`, not its own —
//! and the gates below walk the tree and red on a `Cargo.toml` that joined
//! neither `members` nor `exclude`. **A new host crate that forgets to join is
//! a red, not a silent gap.**
