//! `cargo run -- --merge-health` — what the eased merge law is trading, measured.
//!
//! `issues/build/the-eased-merge-law-carries-a-threshold.md` names the trade the
//! owner made on 2026-08-20: `main`'s checks are its own branch's, not the
//! merged result's, and a red-`main` incident is adjudicated after the fact
//! rather than refused before it. That is a deliberate correctness/throughput
//! trade, not a free one, and the same file fixes a threshold for it in
//! advance — near-zero expected, one interaction failure or more than one
//! red-`main` incident in a rolling week breaches it. This is the instrument
//! that reads the rate back, on demand and from the nightly schedule alike, so
//! the threshold is checked against measurement rather than memory.
//!
//! **What "red" means here is the four push-triggered workflows** that fire on
//! every push to `main` — `ci` (whose `guest-suite` job is the required
//! check), `host tests` (`host`), `toolchain` (`build`), `landing`
//! (`gate-stage`; `abi-split` is a no-op on a push event) — read at the
//! workflow level. That is a coarser reading than the required *check* names
//! `landing.yml`'s `gate-stage` job enforces, but a push-triggered run has no
//! other job competing to fail it, so workflow conclusion and required-check
//! conclusion agree in practice; the first backfill (this file's own dated
//! report) verified that by hand against the job-level breakdown.
//!
//! **What this does not do**, on purpose: it does not read job logs to name
//! *which test* failed, and it does not classify a red as an interaction
//! failure versus an ordinary flake — both are judgment calls a human or an
//! agent makes by reading the run, the way the first backfill did. This prints
//! the raw counts, the check each red named, and the mechanical half of the
//! verdict (incident count against the threshold); a breach on interaction
//! failures specifically is never something a rate alone can say.
//!
//! **The regime is read, not assumed.** The eased law was itself provisional
//! — `landing.yml`'s `gate-stage` job reads `main`'s branch protection back on
//! every push and already prints whether a `merge_queue` rule is present; this
//! file asks the same question through `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/main`,
//! the endpoint `gate-stage` reads, and looks for `merge_queue` among the rule
//! types exactly the way `gate-stage`'s own `queued=...` line does. If it is
//! there, the window is split at the instant the queue started, and the two
//! parts are reported (and verdicted) separately, then totalled as before. A
//! `gh` call that cannot answer at all (no network, no auth) is the only case
//! this falls back on: it says so and reports the window undivided, exactly
//! as this file did before it knew regimes existed — it never guesses one.
//!
//! **The queue's start is the earliest `merge_group`-triggered workflow run**
//! on `gh-readonly-queue/main/*` on record, not the ruleset's own `updated_at`:
//! `updated_at` moves on *any* later edit to *any* rule, an unrelated
//! required-check addition included, and would silently misdate the regime
//! rather than refusing; the first `merge_group` run is a fact about the queue
//! actually processing a landing and cannot be perturbed that way. If the
//! rule is required but has never yet run one, the boundary is "now": nothing
//! in any window so far can be attributed to a queue nobody has used.
//!
//! **Under a queue, an incident is not the same finding it was under the
//! eased law, and a red on `main`'s tip is not by itself evidence the queue
//! failed.** The eased-part verdict keeps its original threshold and text —
//! it is the record of why the queue came, not a live gate any more. The
//! queue-part verdict has no threshold to breach, but it also does not treat
//! every push-triggered red as a queue failure: a merge queue validates a
//! commit in a separate run, on the `merge_group` event, *before* landing it
//! ("the composition run"), and that run is a different execution from the
//! push-triggered run ("the tip run") that fires after the merge on `main`'s
//! own history — so the tip run can still catch an ordinary flake the
//! composition run did not happen to hit, with no composition failure
//! involved at all. [`fetch_composition`]'s doc comment has the verified fact
//! this keys on: a `merge_group` run's `headSha` is the exact commit that
//! becomes `main`'s tip, so [`verdict_queued`] looks up each incident's own
//! composition run by that shared key rather than assuming guilt. Composition
//! green for every incident is `QUEUE HELD` — the tip run's red is a fact
//! about that run, adjudicated against `src/redlist.rs` like any other red,
//! never charged to the queue. Composition red or missing for even one is
//! `QUEUE DID NOT HOLD`, naming only those — a commit that reached `main`'s
//! tip without validating clean first is the specific failure a queue exists
//! to prevent, and root `CLAUDE.md`'s rule that a red on `main`'s tip is
//! adjudicated at once, not batched into a rolling-week rate, applies to it
//! directly.
