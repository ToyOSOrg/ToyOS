//! Making a linked worktree buildable, and saying why when it cannot be.
//!
//! `git worktree add` alone leaves a tree that does not build and, worse, one
//! that builds *wrongly*: `rust/` comes out an empty stub, so the build system
//! reads it as a missing submodule, clones 913 MiB from the network, bootstraps
//! a second 47 GiB toolchain, and finally points the machine-global rustup
//! `toyos` name at it — taking the toolchain out from under every other
//! checkout. Measured, in that order, on this host.
//!
//! So the shared state stays shared and nothing here copies it: `rust/` is left
//! the stub it was, and [`crate::toolchain::rust_dir`] sends every read to the
//! primary checkout. What this module does is the small remainder — create the
//! worktree, carry over the one file git cannot, and refuse by name when the
//! result would not be usable.
