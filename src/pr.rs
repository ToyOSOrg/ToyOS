//! `cargo run -- --pr` and `cargo run -- --sync` — the landing protocol after
//! it moved to GitHub.
//!
//! Landing used to be `--land`: an integration lock on this host, `git merge
//! --no-ff main`, the whole suite as a gate, `git -C <primary> merge --ff-only`.
//! The gate ran on the dev host, which is arm64 cross-arch TCG, and there is a
//! class of defect that machine cannot execute at
//! all — 64 boots of 64 lost on an AMD host while every run here stayed green.
//! So the gate moved to twelve KVM shards on x86_64 and the merge moved with it.
//!
//! What did *not* move is the property the gate rests on. `--land` merged main
//! into the branch and gated the **merged result**, which is what catches a
//! semantic conflict between two branches that each pass alone. GitHub's native
//! merge queue is the feature that provides that, and since 2026-08-20 it is
//! **on**: the repository moved to the `ToyOSOrg` organization (the rule type
//! is org-only — measured on the personal account as `Validation Failed:
//! Invalid rule 'merge_queue'`, which is the history the strict-substitute era
//! below came from), and `main`'s ruleset carries a required `merge_queue`
//! rule. The queue builds each merge's exact composition and runs the required
//! checks on it before `main` moves; `gh pr merge --auto --merge` enqueues.
//!
//! Before the organization existed, the substitute was a **strict** required
//! status check — branches up to date before merging — which bought the same
//! property by serialising landings: the first merge moved main and every
//! other branch was stale until it merged again. That tax, its measured
//! breach, and the eased-law interlude between the two regimes are the
//! tracker's record (`the-eased-merge-law-carries-a-threshold`); `--pr`
//! remains the local half either way.
//!
//! Nothing here rewrites history and nothing pushes `main`.
