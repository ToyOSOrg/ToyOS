//! The instrument every guest in this project is measured with, declared once.
//!
//! The measurement this exists for: on one runner image, one commit and one
//! accelerator, `desktop_typing_damage` is red on
//! QEMU 8.2.2 and green on 11.0.3, and `usb_storage_shapes` with it. So the
//! QEMU version is not a detail of the environment — it decides verdicts, and
//! a job that does not say which one it ran produces a number nobody can
//! compare with another.
//!
//! `.github/qemu-version` is that declaration. CI reads it from
//! `.github/instrument.sh` and **reds** on a disagreement, because `debian:sid`
//! is a rolling release and the alternative is an instrument that moves out
//! from under every recorded measurement in silence. This host reads it and
//! **notes** a disagreement, because brew moves QEMU when it feels like it and
//! a build must not stop for that — but the dev host is where
//! `tests/audio-baseline.toml` was recorded, so it drifting is the same fact
//! about the same comparison and has to be visible.
