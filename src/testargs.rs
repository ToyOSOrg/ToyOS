//! costs nothing and its *value* becomes that filter, so a command line naming
//! a deleted flag runs one test and reports the run as a pass, and nothing
//! between such a command line and a green check refuses it.
//!
//! So the flag table is here, one entry per flag the harness reads, and the

//! this table is refused the first time anyone types it — the drift that is
//! loud rather than the one that narrows a gate.
