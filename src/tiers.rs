//! Which tests every `cargo test` runs, and which ones it does not — as data,
//! with what each relegation costs the tree written beside it.
//!
//! **The owner's line, 2026-08-11: the fast per-PR path runs tests taking ten
//! seconds or less.** Everything above it moves to a nightly tier, scheduled in
//! `.github/workflows/ci.yml` at `03:00 UTC` and reachable on demand through
//! `--nightly` or a `workflow_dispatch`. This module is that decision as data:
//! [`RELEGATED`] is exactly the set the nightly job selects, and `tests/toyos.rs`
//! writes [`Tier::Nightly`] against each of those names in its own registration.
//!
//! **This is interim and it is a loss.** Most of the committed profile's priced
//! time is Nightly, for three reasons a row's [`Why`] names: a CI price without
//! margin ([`Why::Cost`] — since 2026-08-21, over [`FAST_COMMIT_MS`] rather
//! than over the ceiling itself), Nightly by classification rather than by cost
//! ([`Why::TimerAnchored`]), or riding `metal_sim_compositor`'s shared boot
//! ([`Why::RidesTheBootOf`]). None of it is gated per pull request. `guards`
//! on every row says what stopped being gated, because a run that quietly does
//! less is the whole failure mode here; the counts are [`RELEGATED`] itself.
//!
//! **Nothing here is an optimisation and nothing here changes an assertion.**
//! A relegated test measures exactly what it measured; the manual nightly
//! command runs it. #188 holds only the optimisation work that would make one
//! of these fast enough to come back to the per-PR tier — and **two names left
//! by that door on 2026-08-17**: `xhci_msi_only` (35,223 ms) and
//! `swiss_german_layout` (12,645 ms) were each a guest binary waiting out a
//! fixed fallback deadline nobody had sent the sentinel for, 30 s and 8 s of
//! host wall clock with no assertion behind either. Both are `Tier::Fast`
//! again, on run 32023797195's twelve shards rather than on the dev host:
//! **5,857 ms and 5,441 ms**.
//!
//! **The fast tier demands margin, 2026-08-21.** [`FAST_COMMIT_MS`] is the
//! price a test may be *committed* at, four fifths of the ceiling, and it is
//! what both directions of the tier rule are decided against: a Fast name may
//! not be priced in the band below the ceiling, and a [`Why::Cost`] row returns
//! only at or under it. Before it, one sample decided both directions, and on
//! one afternoon three straddlers bounced every merge-queue entry in turn. Read
//! [`FAST_COMMIT_MS`] for the derivation and the three names.
//!
//! **CI is the instrument for a per-PR policy.** The effective profile starts
//! with the last full twelve-shard run and replaces every name measured by the
//! first fast-tier run. That retains a price for withheld tests while using the
//! freshest CI price for everything the fast tier did execute. Dev-host TCG
//! timings remain useful optimisation evidence, but they do not decide which
//! side of a KVM CI cutoff a test belongs on.
//!
//! **The nightly renders the verdict; a landing renders only its own names,
//! 2026-08-22.** The rule here is unchanged and so is the ceiling — what moved
//! is which run's red stops a landing. A pull request's and a merge-queue
//! composition's `durations` job refuses a price verdict only for the names
//! that change registered or re-tiered, and prints every other one as a
//! `::warning::`; the nightly's twelve hosted shards pass no base and refuse
//! them all, and a nightly red is fixed by a pull request the next day like
//! every other nightly red. The reason is a measurement, not a preference: over
//! six hosted twelve-shard runs a per-shard common price factor explains 57% of
//! a name's run-to-run variance and spreads 1.28x p10–p90
//! (`issues/build/a-shards-boot-width-does-not-price-its-tests.md`), so a name
//! priced anywhere near a line reads over it on some runs by shard luck alone —
//! and under the required merge queue that red dequeues the whole composition,
//! every pull request behind it included. [`ci_profile_verdicts`] is the shape
//! that filtering needs: one verdict per name, each saying whether it is about a
//! price. A verdict about the *declaration* — a marker on a Nightly row, a
//! duplicate row, an empty `guards`, a rider on a carrier that is not Nightly —
//! is true whoever measured it and is refused on every run.
