//! The xHCI root-hub port machine, as a decision separated from its effects.
//!
//! The kernel reads PORTSC, asks [`port::PortState::step`] what to do, and does
//! it; nothing here touches a register, a ring or a slot. That split is what
//! lets a host simulator explore the port state space, which is where the
//! laptop's SuperSpeed wedge lives — a state QEMU cannot produce.
