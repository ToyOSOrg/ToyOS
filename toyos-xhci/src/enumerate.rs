//! Everything between a port that has finished its reset and a device the
//! driver can bind, as an order and the two places it branches.
//!
//! The shape is [`crate::recovery`]'s and for the same reason: the sequence has
//! two drivers. A boot scan runs it to the end in place, because there is no
//! scheduler yet to give a pass back to; a hot plug runs one act per scheduler
//! pass, because there is, and `poll_if_pending` is at the top of every one of
//! them. A second implementation for the second driver would be two orders to
//! keep in step, and the one that only runs on hardware nobody has plugged into
//! is the one that would rot.
//!
//! **What is here is the order and nothing else.** Which endpoints an interface
//! offered, what a slot id is, where a ring lives — none of that decides what
//! comes next, so none of it is here.
