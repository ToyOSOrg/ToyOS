//! What a SuperSpeed port needs, which is not what a USB2 port needs.
//!
//! **None of this is reachable in QEMU.** Its xHC has no link training and no
//! Inactive state; its SS ports read Enabled the moment the register is
//! touched, and no device or machine property makes a reset fail. So the guest
//! suite can only certify that nothing regressed, and correctness for these
//! paths lives here — which is why the negative gates beside them matter more
//! than usual.
