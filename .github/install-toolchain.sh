# The toolchain `toolchain.yml` published for this tree, installed and linked
# as `toyos`. One script rather than a copy in each caller (the shards, `tcg`,
# `cache-writer`, gate A), so a retry-loop disagreement is not possible.
#
# The asset, not the tag: `gh release create` makes the release and then
# uploads to it, so a tag that answers 200 is not an installable toolchain.
# `ci.yml`'s `toolchain-ready` asks the same question before any of these jobs
# start, so the wait here is short — anything still missing is the API rather
# than a build.
#
# `$TAG` if the caller already computed it (a `cache` key wants it as a step
# output), otherwise the same `git rev-parse` `toolchain.yml` publishes under.
# `$GH_TOKEN` authenticates the release download; `gh` itself is not here —
# the `debian:sid` image has none.
