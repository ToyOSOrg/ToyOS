<!--
This body becomes the merge commit's body on `main`, so write it as the record
of what landed rather than as a note to a reviewer. `git log --no-merges` is
still how you read the work itself.

**Do not hard-wrap the prose.** GitHub wraps this body itself when it composes
the merge commit, and a paragraph you have already wrapped at 78 comes out
ragged at 72 — measured on the first merge through this workflow, `1d43976`.
One line per paragraph; bullets on one line each.

Delete anything below that has nothing to say. An empty heading is worse than
no heading.

## What this changes


## Why


## Evidence
<!--
Numbers come from a command that was actually run, with the run id or the
command. An estimate says it is one. -->


## Anything a reader of `main` must not miss
<!--
A known red this leaves behind, a `src/redlist.rs` quarantine row it adds, an
`issues/` file it closes or invalidates.
