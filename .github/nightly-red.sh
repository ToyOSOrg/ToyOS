# One standing issue for a nightly red, found by title and updated rather than
# recreated. Shared by every nightly-red job in ci.yml, gate-a.yml and
# host-tests.yml so they do not carry separate copies of the same find-or-file
# logic. Every caller gates on its own run's result before calling this, so a
# green scheduled run never reaches it.
#
# The issue is the alarm and not the record: every nightly red is adjudicated
# the same day into a fix, a `src/redlist.rs` quarantine row, or a tier move.
#
# $TITLE names the issue; $BODY becomes a comment on it, or the body of a new
# one if none is open yet. $GH_TOKEN is what `gh issue` authenticates with.

# /bin/sh has no `pipefail`, so a `gh` piped straight into `head` would let a
# `gh` failure fall through as an empty `number` — read as "no open issue" and
# answered by filing a duplicate. `gh issue list` runs alone below so its own
# exit status is what `set -e` sees; only the already-captured text is piped.
