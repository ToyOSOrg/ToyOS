# Three variables a verdict from this job must be read against: the QEMU
# version against `.github/qemu-version` — a disagreement reds, since
# `debian:sid` is a rolling release and the remedy is to record the new
# version, not to carry on; the host CPU vendor, since `kvm_amd` and
# `kvm_intel` are both in play
# and not selectable; and whether `/dev/kvm` is there *and opens*, the only
# difference between a `guest` shard and the `tcg` canary.
#
# Run from the repository root, after the checkout, by every job that boots a
# guest.
