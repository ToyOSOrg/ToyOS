//! GPT parsing, for the one question ToyOS asks a partition table: **where is
//! the partition firmware booted us from?**
//!
//! Not "which partition looks like an ESP". The bootloader takes the unique
//! partition GUID out of its own `LoadedImage` device path while Boot Services
//! are still alive and hands it to the kernel; this crate finds *that* GUID in
//! *that* device's table, or refuses. Searching for a type GUID, or for the
//! first FAT-looking thing, is how an operating system reformats a disk that
//! belongs to somebody else — the same class of defect `bcachefs_adapter::probe`
//! exists to prevent, and the reason `5dff9aa` exists.
//!
//! Everything here treats the disk as hostile. A GPT is bytes an attacker (or
//! a dying flash controller) may have written: every length, count and LBA in
//! it is checked before it is used, nothing is indexed without a bound, and no
//! path panics. The kernel's fail-fast rule is for kernel bugs, never for
//! input that crossed a trust boundary.
//!
//! `no_std`, no allocation, no `unsafe`: the entry array is streamed a block
//! at a time through [`Sectors`], so nothing here is sized by a number the
//! disk chose.
